# Anything that we download must have a COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_URL{_[0-9]+} macro
# that tells us where the canonical source for the archive can be found.  The
# macro for the first archive is typically un-suffixed.  By convention,
# subsequent archives will include a _[0-9]+ in the macro name.  This allows
# an arbitrary number of archives to be downloaded for a particular component
# Makefile.  It is also important to note that there is a corresponding
# COMPONENT_ARCHIVE macro defining a local file name for the archive, and
# optional COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_HASH and COMPONENT_SIG_URL containing a hash of
# the file and signature for verification of its contents.
