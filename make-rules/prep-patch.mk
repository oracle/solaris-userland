# Rules for patching source that is downloaded and unpacked or pulled from
# a source repository.  Patches should be named
# patches/{patch-file-name}.patch{version} where {patch-file-name} is a
# meaningful name for the patch contents and {version} corresponds to the
# COMPONENT_NAME{version} of the source to be patched.  Typically, version
# would be something like "_1", "_2", ...  After all {version} patches have
# been applied, a final set of patches without a {version} suffix may be
# applied.
#
# PATCH_DIR can be overridden to move patches to a different location
# PATCH_PATTERN can be overridden to adjust the patch naming scheme that the
#     build recognizes.
# ADDITIONAL_PATCHES can be defined in the component Makefile to include
#     additional patches.
#

# We are interested in *.patch and *.patch_*
# *.patch is applied against $(COMPONENT_SRC)
# *.patch_blah is applied against $(COMPONENT_SRC_blah)
