# Some components don't have an archive that we download, but host their source
# directly in the repo, and a separate unpacking step will fail.  So we don't do
# any unpacking if COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_SRC is "none", and rely on such components
# to set that variable specifically.
#
# The reason we don't condition on an empty COMPONENT_ARCHIVE is that any
# components that rely on that being set by default by prep.mk won't have it set
# for this conditional.  It's easier to make the very few archive-less
# components declare themselves rather than force everyone else to use
# boilerplate code to name their archives.
