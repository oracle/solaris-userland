# TESTING:
#   Requires physical card reader attached to USB with card inserted.
#   SCM Microsystems, model SCR3310 is what was used in-house to test.
#
#   To build the test:
#   $ cd build/[64-bit directory]
#   $ gmake build-test
#
#   To run the test:
#   $ cd build/[64-bit directory]
#   $ ./testcackey> testoutput.log
#
#   If the last line of output says:
#   Testing libcackey... DONE. Status = 0
#   then you have a finished test and results.
#   Search for CK_FAIL or "failed" in testoutput.log to see the actual failures,
#   if no CK_FAIL or failed were reported, the test ran successfully.
