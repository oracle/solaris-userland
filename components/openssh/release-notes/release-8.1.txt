OpenSSH 8.1 was released on 2019-10-09. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Security
========

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): an exploitable integer
   overflow bug was found in the private key parsing code for the XMSS
   key type. This key type is still experimental and support for it is
   not compiled by default. No user-facing autoconf option exists in
   portable OpenSSH to enable it. This bug was found by Adam Zabrocki
   and reported via SecuriTeam's SSD program.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-agent(1): add protection for private keys at
   rest in RAM against speculation and memory side-channel attacks like
   Spectre, Meltdown and Rambleed. This release encrypts private keys
   when they are not in use with a symmetric key that is derived from a
   relatively large "prekey" consisting of random data (currently 16KB).

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * ssh-keygen(1): when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
   an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
   Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
   with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
   overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").

Changes since OpenSSH 8.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug-fixing.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
   default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
   "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"

 * ssh-keygen(1): add an experimental lightweight signature and
   verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
   held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
   authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
   namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
   usage domains (e.g. files vs email).

 * ssh-keygen(1): print key comment when extracting public key from a
   private key.  bz#3052

 * ssh-keygen(1): accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
   in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
   host's random-art signature too. bz#3003

 * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
   keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
   but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
   non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
   key derivation function than PEM's.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): if a PKCS#11 token returns no keys then try to login and
   refetch them. Based on patch from Jakub Jelen; bz#2430

 * ssh(1): produce a useful error message if the user's shell is set
   incorrectly during "match exec" processing. bz#2791

 * sftp(1): allow the maximum uint32 value for the argument passed
   to -b which allows better error messages from later validation.
   bz#3050

 * ssh(1): avoid pledge sandbox violations in some combinations of
   remote forwarding, connection multiplexing and ControlMaster.

 * ssh-keyscan(1): include SHA2-variant RSA key algorithms in KEX
   proposal; allows ssh-keyscan to harvest keys from servers that
   disable old SHA1 ssh-rsa. bz#3029

 * sftp(1): print explicit "not modified" message if a file was
   requested for resumed download but was considered already complete.
   bz#2978

 * sftp(1): fix a typo and make <esc><right> move right to the
   closest end of a word just like <esc><left> moves left to the
   closest beginning of a word.

 * sshd(8): cap the number of permitopen/permitlisten directives
   allowed to appear on a single authorized_keys line.

 * All: fix a number of memory leaks (one-off or on exit paths).

 * Regression tests: a number of fixes and improvements, including
   fixes to the interop tests, adding the ability to run most tests
   on builds that disable OpenSSL support, better support for running
   tests under Valgrind and a number of bug-fixes.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): check for convtime() refusing to accept times that
   resolve to LONG_MAX Reported by Kirk Wolf bz2977

 * ssh(1): slightly more instructive error message when the user
   specifies multiple -J options on the command-line. bz3015

 * ssh-agent(1): process agent requests for RSA certificate private
   keys using correct signature algorithm when requested. bz3016

 * sftp(1): check for user@host when parsing sftp target. This
   allows user@[1.2.3.4] to work without a path.  bz#2999

 * sshd(8): enlarge format buffer size for certificate serial
   number so the log message can record any 64-bit integer without
   truncation. bz#3012

 * sshd(8): for PermitOpen violations add the remote host and port to
   be able to more easily ascertain the source of the request. Add the
   same logging for PermitListen violations which where not previously
   logged at all.

 * scp(1), sftp(1): use the correct POSIX format style for left
   justification for the transfer progress meter. bz#3002

 * sshd(8) when examining a configuration using sshd -T, assume any
   attribute not provided by -C does not match, which allows it to work
   when sshd_config contains a Match directive with or without -C.
   bz#2858

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): downgrade PKCS#11 "provider returned no
   slots" warning from log level error to debug. This is common when
   attempting to enumerate keys on smartcard readers with no cards
   plugged in. bz#3058

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): do not unconditionally log in to PKCS#11
   tokens. Avoids spurious PIN prompts for keys not selected for
   authentication in ssh(1) and when listing public keys available in
   a token using ssh-keygen(1). bz#3006

Portability
-----------

 * ssh(1): fix SIGWINCH delivery of Solaris for multiplexed sessions
   bz#3030

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix typo that prevented detection of Linux VRF

 * sshd(8): add no-op implementation of pam_putenv to avoid build
   breakage on platforms where the PAM implementation lacks this
   function (e.g. HP-UX). bz#3008

 * sftp-server(8): fix Solaris privilege sandbox from preventing
   the legacy sftp rename operation from working (was refusing to
   allow hard links to files owned by other users). bz#3036

 * All: add a proc_pidinfo()-based closefrom() for OS X to avoid
   the need to brute-force close all high-numbered file descriptors.
   bz#3049

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow mprotect(2) with
   PROT_(READ|WRITE|NONE) only. This syscall is used by some hardened
   heap allocators. Github PR#142

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow the s390-specific
   ioctl for ECC hardware support.

 * All: use "doc" man page format if the mandoc(1) tool is present on
   the system. Previously configure would not select the "doc" man
   page format if mandoc was present but nroff was not.

 * sshd(8): don't install duplicate STREAMS modules on Solaris; check
   if STREAMS modules are already installed on a pty before installing
   since when compiling with XPG>=4 they will likely be installed
   already. Prevents hangs and duplicate lines on the terminal.
   bz#2945 and bz#2998,
