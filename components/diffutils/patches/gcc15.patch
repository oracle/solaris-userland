GCC 15 changed how it handles static_assert in C11 and now always expands the  
static_assert macro from Solaris /usr/include/assert.h, which requires two  
arguments. Previously, GCC 14 would sometimes treat static_assert as a keyword  
and allow a single-argument form, so builds succeeded even on Solaris.

Solaris specific.
