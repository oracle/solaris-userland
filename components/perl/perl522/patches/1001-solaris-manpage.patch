+=head2 Oracle Solaris Specific Notes
+
+The perl versions shipped with Solaris are installed in version-specific
+subdirectories under F</usr/perl5>, so that they can coexist with other
+versions of perl, including a customer-installed Perl in another location.

+version of perl are controlled via the B<pkg>(7) mediator named C<perl>.
