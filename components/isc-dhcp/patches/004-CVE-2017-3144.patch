commit ccff9ed69d0b26d33ce9cac8e83dab535b64d627

    [46767] Plugged a socket descriptor leak in OMAPI
    
    If disconnect is triggered by the reader closing the socket, while there
    is data left to write, the socket would be orphaned.
    
    omapip/buffer.c
        omapi_connection_writea() - added logic to recall disconnect once
        pending data has been written
    
    omapip/message.c
        Removed static declaration from omapi_message_unregister so you can
        actually compile when DEBUG_PROTOCOL is defined.
    
    Added a release note
