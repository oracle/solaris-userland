The patch fixes the test that checks that no internal
symbols are exposed. Solaris adds .SUNW_.* sections
with additional public symbols that are not considered
in this test. The patch adds these symbols to
IGNORED_SYMBOLS variable to fix it.

The patch is related Solaris internals, therefore,
it is not suitable for upstream.
