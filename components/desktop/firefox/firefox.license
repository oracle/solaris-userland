2. License Grants and Conditions

  2.1. Grants

   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications,
       or as part of a Larger Work; and
    b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.

  2.2. Effective Date

   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor
   first distributes such Contribution.

  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted
   under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied
   from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this
   License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
   granted by a Contributor:
    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its
       Contributor Version); or
    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.

   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service
   marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to
   comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License
   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

  2.5. Representation

   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

  2.6. Fair Use

   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.

  2.7. Conditions

   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
   Form.

  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
    a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients
       of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source
       Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no
       more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and
   the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).

  3.4. Notices

   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered
   by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for
   any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
   additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability
   specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
   must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the
   Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
   statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
   for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

  5.1.

   The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on
   an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is
   the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this
   License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30
   days after Your receipt of the notice.

  5.2.

   If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
   2.1 of this License shall terminate.

  5.3.

   In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
   user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
   have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this
   License prior to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
   free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
   non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
   the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
   defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
   any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
   warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
   Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
   disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
   (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
   or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
   liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
   damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
   failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
   of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
   liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
   negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
   jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply
   to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
   courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
   place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
   cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
   that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
   shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

  10.1. New Versions

   Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in
   Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
   modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be
   given a distinguishing version number.

  10.2. Effect of New Versions

   You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
   of the License under which You originally received the Covered
   Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the
   license steward.

  10.3. Modified Versions

   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
   create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
   modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
   such modified license differs from this License).

  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

   If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
   Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
   notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

     This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
     License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
     file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

   If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
   file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
   file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
   for such a notice.

   You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

     This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
     defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

  Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
   are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
   below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
   price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
   if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
   in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
   things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
   is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
   by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
   they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
   reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
   others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any
   patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent
   with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
   GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public
   License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
   different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
   for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
   non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
   shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of
   an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are
   the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
   becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library
   does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case,
   there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
   only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
   software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
   programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
   system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
   program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
   authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
   Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
   has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
   means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
   program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
   it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
   program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:
     * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
     * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
     * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
       invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
       the event an application does not supply such function or table,
       the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
       purpose remains meaningful.
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
       purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
       function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
   Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
   of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
   a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
   with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
   isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
   outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section
   6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
   (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
   will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
   or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
   a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
   terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
   the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
   of these things:
     * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
       the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
     * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
     * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
       performing this distribution.
     * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
     * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
   executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,
   and provided that you do these two things:
     * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
     * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
       find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
   Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
   those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
   only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented
   by public license practices. Many people have made generous
   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
   system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
   to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
   choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
   add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
   countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
   version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
   Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
   Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
   guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
   derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
   of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

                     GNU Lesser General Public License 3.0

   Some versions of this product contains code from the following LGPLed
   libraries:
     * Swedish dictionary

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
              <https://www.fsf.org/>

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
   terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
   supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions

   As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
   GNU General Public License.

   “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
   than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

   An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
   the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining
   a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
   an interface provided by the Library.

   A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
   Version”.

   The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

   The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
     * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
       to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
       function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
     * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
       this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
   header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
   fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
     * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
       by this License.
     * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
       license document.

  4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
   together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
   the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
     * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
       the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
     * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
       license document.
     * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
       execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
       notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
       the GNU GPL and this license document.
     * d) Do one of the following:
          + 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
            this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
            suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
            recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
            the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
            manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
            Corresponding Source.
          + 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
            the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
            time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
            computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
            version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
            Linked Version.
     * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
       otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
       of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
       necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined
       Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
       modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
       Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
       Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
       you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
       specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
       Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side by side in a single library together with other library facilities
   that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
   convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do
   both of the following:
     * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
       conveyed under the terms of this License.
     * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
       is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
       accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
   Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
   have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
   published version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify
   a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
   choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
   published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

              2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions

l,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute

l,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

You
                  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Wo
rk
                  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes dir
ect
                  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminat
e
                  as of the date such litigation is filed.

              4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or withou
t
                  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                  meet the following conditions:

                  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notic
es
                      stating that You changed the files; and

                  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Work
s
                      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                      the Derivative Works; and

                  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribut
e must
                      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contain
ed
                      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do n
ot
                      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least o
ne
                      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distrib
uted
                      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works
; or,
                      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The con
tents
                      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attributio
n
                      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, along
side
                      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provid
ed
                      that such additional attribution notices cannot be constru
ed
                      as modifying the License.

                  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
 and
                  may provide additional or different license terms and conditio
ns
                  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
or
                  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
                  the conditions stated in this License.

              5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherw
ise,
                  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
                  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
 of
                  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or m
odify
                  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have execu
ted
                  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

              6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the t
rade
                  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Lice
nsor,
                  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describ
ing the
                  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE f
ile.

              7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express o
r
                  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or cond
itions
                  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
 the
                  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
 any
                  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

              8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise
,
                  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and gros
sly
                  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
 be
                  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, spe
cial,
                  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
as a
                  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use t
he
                  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwil
l,
                  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributin
g
                  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemni
ty,
                  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with t
his
                  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act o
nly
                  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on beh
alf
                  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by r
eason
                  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            5. Time Zone Database

              ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
            Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
            is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
            Database section 7.

            # 7.  Database Ownership
            #
            #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
            #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated wo
rk
            #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
            #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] d
o
            #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals
make
            #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the
 TZ
            #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
            #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
            #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accord
ance
            #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be m
ade
            #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any pe
rson
            #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights
 to
            #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
