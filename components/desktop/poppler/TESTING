### PREPARING ENVIRONMENT ###

# Install the poppler library on your testing machine.
# $ sudo pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.desktop/pdf-viewer/poppler=false
# $ sudo pkg install poppler@YOUR_VERSION
# Start gnome environment in order to perform the following tests.
#
# For example, you can setup a vnc server on your virtual testing machine:
# [test-virt]$ vncserver -SecurityTypes None
# In order to connect to your virtual machine execute the following command
# [localhost]$ vncviewer ${IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE}:1
# where ${IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE} is the IP address of your testing machine.

# Testing file from print/filter/ghostscript-core component.
TEST_PDF_FILE=$(ls /usr/share/ghostscript/*/examples/text_graphic_image.pdf)


### TEST PACKAGES THAT USE LIBPOPPLER ###

# Check the linkage of desktop/pdf-viewer/evince,
# library/desktop/search/tracker, and image/graphviz components.
# The output of the following commands should be empty.
find /usr/lib/ -name 'libpdfdocument.so' -exec ldd {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep "not found"
find /usr/lib/ -name 'libextract-pdf.so' -exec ldd {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep "not found"
find /usr/lib/ -name 'libgvplugin_poppler.so' -exec ldd {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep "not found"

# Check that tracker is able to extract information from the provided pdf file.
# Output should be similar to:
