                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

contrib/pngminus/README.txt

PngMinus
--------
(copyright Willem van Schaik, 1999-2019)



Some history
------------
Soon after the creation of PNG in 1995, the need was felt for a set of
pnmtopng / pngtopnm utilities. Independently Alexander Lehmann and I
(Willem van Schaik) started such a project. Luckily we discovered this
and merged the two, which later became part of NetPBM, available from
SourceForge.

These two utilities have many, many options and make use of most of the
features of PNG, like gamma, alpha, sbit, text-chunks, etc. This makes
the utilities quite complex and by now not anymore very maintainable.
When we wrote these programs, libpng was still in an early stage.
Therefore, lots of the functionality that we put in our software can now
be done using transform-functions in libpng.

Finally, to compile these programs, you need to have installed and
compiled three libraries: libpng, zlib and netpbm. Especially the latter
makes the whole setup a bit bulky. But that's unavoidable given the many
features of pnmtopng.


What now (1999)
---------------
At this moment libpng is in a very stable state and can do much of the
work done in pnmtopng. Also, pnmtopng needs to be upgraded to the new
interface of libpng. Hence, it is time for a rewrite from the ground up
of pnmtopng and pngtopnm. This will happen in the near future (stay
tuned). The new package will get a different name to distinguish it from
the old one: PngPlus.

To experiment a bit with the new interface of libpng, I started off with
a small prototype that contains only the basic functionality. It doesn't
have any of the options to read or write special chunks and it will do
no gamma correction. But this makes it also a simple program that is
quite easy to understand and can serve well as a template for other
software developments. By now there are of course a couple of programs,
like Greg Roelofs' rpng/wpng, that can be used just as good.


Can and can not
---------------
As this is the small brother of the future PngPlus, I called this fellow
PngMinus. Because I started this development in good-old Turbo-C, I
avoided the use the netpbm library, which requires DOS extenders. Again,
another reason to call it PngMinus (minus netpbm :-). So, part of the
program are some elementary routines to read / write pgm- and ppm-files.
It does not handle B&W pbm-files, but instead you could do pgm with bit-
depth 1.

The downside of this approach is that you can not use them on images
that require blocks of memory bigger than 64k (the DOS version). For
larger images you will get an out-of-memory error.

As said before, PngMinus doesn't correct for gamma. When reading
png-files you can do this just as well by piping the output of png2pnm
to pnmgamma, one of the standard PbmPlus tools. This same scenario will
most probably also be followed in the full-blown future PngPlus, with
the addition of course of the possibility to create gamma-chunks when
writing png-files.

On the other hand it supports alpha-channels. When reading a png-image
you can write the alpha-channel into a pgm-file. And when creating an
RGB+A png-image, you just combine a ppm-file with a corresponding
pgm-file containing the alpha-channel. When reading, transparency chunks
are converted into an alpha-channel and from there on treated the same
way.

Finally you can opt for writing ascii or binary pgm- and ppm-files. When
the bit-depth is 16, the format will always be ascii.


Using it
--------
To distinguish them from pnmtopng and PngPlus, the utilities are named
png2pnm and pnm2png (2 instead of to). The input- and output-files can
be given as parameters or through redirection. Therefore the programs
can be part of a pipe.

To list the options type "png2pnm -h" or "pnm2png -h".


Just like Scandinavian furniture
--------------------------------
You have to put it together yourself. I developed the software on MS-DOS
with Turbo-C 3.0 and RedHat Linux 4.2 with gcc. In both cases I used
libpng-1.0.4 and zlib-1.1.3. By now (2019) it is twenty years later and
more current versions are OK.

The makefile assumes that the libpng libraries can be found in ../.. and
libz in ../../../zlib. But you can change this to for example ../libpng
and ../zlib. The makefile creates two versions of each program, one with
static library support and the other using shared libraries.

If you create a ../pngsuite directory and then store the basn####.png
files from PngSuite (http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/) in there, you can
test the proper functioning of PngMinus by running pngminus.sh.


Warranty
-------
Please, remember that this was just a small experiment to learn a few
things. It will have many unforeseen features <vbg> ... who said bugs? Use
it when you are in need for something simple or when you want a starting
point for developing your own stuff.

Instructions for building libpng using Microsoft Visual Studio
==============================================================

Copyright (c) 2018,2022 Cosmin Truta
Copyright (c) 2010,2013,2015 Glenn Randers-Pehrson

This code is released under the libpng license.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the disclaimer and license
in png.h

This directory contains a solution for building libpng under Microsoft
Visual Studio 2019.  It may also work under earlier or later versions
of Visual Studio.  You should be familiar with Visual Studio before
using this solution.

Initial preparations
--------------------
You must enter some information in zlib.props before attempting to
build with this 'solution'.  Please read and edit zlib.props first.
You will probably not be familiar with the contents of zlib.props -
do not worry, it is mostly harmless.

This is all you need to do to build the 'release' and 'release library'
configurations.

Debugging
---------
The release configurations default to /Ox optimization.  Full debugging
information is produced (in the .pdb), but if you encounter a problem
the optimization may make it difficult to debug.  Simply rebuild with a
lower optimization level (e.g. /Od.)

Linking your application
------------------------
Normally you should link against the 'release' configuration.  This
builds a DLL for libpng with the default runtime options used by Visual
Studio.  In particular the runtime library is the "MultiThreaded DLL"
version.  If you use Visual Studio defaults to build your application,
you should have no problems.

If you don't use the Visual Studio defaults your application must still
be built with the default runtime option (/MD).  If, for some reason,
it is not then your application will crash inside libpng16.dll as soon
as libpng tries to read from a file handle you pass in.

If you do not want to use the DLL, and prefer static linking instead,
you may choose the 'release library' configuration.  This is built with
a non-standard runtime library - the "MultiThreaded" version.  When you
build your application, it must be compiled with this option (/MT),
otherwise it will not build (if you are lucky) or it will crash (if you
are not.) See the WARNING file that is distributed with this README.

Stop reading here
-----------------
You have enough information to build a working application.

Debug versions have limited support
-----------------------------------
This solution includes limited support for debug versions of libpng.
You do not need these unless your own solution itself uses debug builds
(it is far more effective to debug on the release builds, there is no
point building a special debug build unless you have heap corruption
problems that you can't track down.)

The debug build of libpng is minimally supported.  Support for debug
builds of zlib is also minimal.  Please keep this in mind, if you want
to use it.

WARNING
-------
Libpng 1.6.x does not use the default run-time library when building
static library builds of libpng; instead of the shared DLL runtime, it
uses a static runtime.  If you need to change this, make sure to change
the setting on all the relevant projects:

    libpng
    zlib
    all the test programs

The runtime library settings for each build are as follows:

               Release        Debug
    DLL         /MD            /MDd
    Library     /MT            /MTd

Also, be sure to build libpng, zlib, and your project, all for the same
platform (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).

png_have_neon implemented for the Android NDK, see:

Documentation:
   http://www.kandroid.org/ndk/docs/CPU-ARM-NEON.html
   https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=49065

NOTE: this requires that libpng is built against the Android NDK and linked
with an implementation of the Android ARM 'cpu-features' library.  The code
has been compiled only, not linked: no version of the library has been found,
only the header files exist in the NDK.

STATUS: COMPILED, TESTED
BUG REPORTS: png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net

png_have_neon implemented for Linux versions which allow access to
/proc/self/auxv.  This is probably faster, cleaner and safer than the code to
read /proc/cpuinfo in contrib/arm-neon/linux, however it is yet another piece
of potentially untested code and has more complex dependencies than the code
to read cpuinfo.

This generic __linux__ implementation requires reading /proc/self/auxv and
looking at each element for one that records NEON capabilities.

STATUS: SUPPORTED
BUG REPORTS: png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net

png_have_neon implemented for Linux by reading the widely available
pseudo-file /proc/cpuinfo.

This code is strict ANSI-C and is probably moderately portable; it does
however use <stdio.h> and it assumes that /proc/cpuinfo is never localized.

 Extract any icc profiles found in the given PNG files.  This is a simple
 example of a program that extracts information from the header of a PNG file
 without processing the image.  Notice that some header information may occur
 after the image data. Textual data and comments are an example; the approach
 in this file won't work reliably for such data because it only looks for the
 information in the section of the file that precedes the image data.

 Compile and link against libpng and zlib, plus anything else required on the
 system you use.

 To use supply a list of PNG files containing iCCP chunks, the chunks will be
 extracted to a similarly named file with the extension replaced by 'icc',
 which will be overwritten without warning.

 Read a single pixel value from a PNG file.

 This code illustrates basic 'by-row' reading of a PNG file using libpng.
 Rows are read until a particular pixel is found; the value of this pixel is
 then printed on stdout.

 The code illustrates how to do this on interlaced as well as non-interlaced
 images.  Normally you would call png_set_interlace_handling() to have libpng
 deal with the interlace for you, but that obliges you to buffer half of the
 image to assemble the interlaced rows.  In this code
 png_set_interlace_handling() is not called and, instead, the code handles
 the interlace passes directly looking for the required pixel.

 Read a PNG and write it out in a fixed format, using the 'simplified API'
 that was introduced in libpng-1.6.0.

 This sample code is just the code from 'example.c' with some error handling
 added.  See example.c in the top-level libpng directory for more comments.

 Read several PNG files, which should have an alpha channel or transparency
 information, and composite them together to produce one or more 16-bit
 linear RGBA intermediates.  This involves doing the 'over' compositing
 operation to combine the alpha channels and corresponding data.

 Finally read an output (background) PNG using the 24-bit RGB format (the
 PNG will be composited on green (#00ff00) by default if it has an alpha
 channel), and apply the intermediate image generated above to specified
 locations in the image.

 The command line has the general format:

    simpleover <background.png> [output.png]
        {--sprite=width,height,name {[--at=x,y] {sprite.png}}}
        {--add=name {x,y}}

 The --sprite and --add options may occur multiple times. They are executed
 in order.  --add may refer to any sprite already read.

 This code is intended to show how to composite multiple images together
 correctly.  Apart from the libpng Simplified API the only work done in here
 is to combine multiple input PNG images into a single sprite; this involves
 a Porter-Duff 'over' operation and the input PNG images may, as a result,
 be regarded as being layered one on top of the other with the first
 (leftmost on the command line) being at the bottom and the last on the top.

 rpng - simple PNG display program                             rpng-win.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG images, with gamma correction and
 optionally with a user-specified background color (in case the image has
 transparency).  It is very nearly the most basic PNG viewer possible.
 This version is for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows
 with a little tweaking (or maybe not).

 to do:
  - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
  - have minimum window width:  oh well
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.00:  initial public release
  - 1.01:  modified to allow abbreviated options; fixed long/ulong mis-
            match; switched to png_jmpbuf() macro
  - 1.02:  added extra set of parentheses to png_jmpbuf() macro; fixed
            command-line parsing bug
  - 1.10:  enabled "message window"/console (thanks to David Geldreich)

 rpng2 - progressive-model PNG display program                rpng2-win.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG files progressively, as if it were
 a web browser (though the front end is only set up to read from files).
 It supports gamma correction, user-specified background colors, and user-
 specified background patterns (for transparent images).  This version is
 for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows with a little
 tweaking (or maybe not).  Thanks to Adam Costello and Pieter S. van der
 Meulen for the "diamond" and "radial waves" patterns, respectively.

 to do (someday, maybe):
  - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
  - finish resizable checkerboard-gradient (sizes 4-128?)
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?
  - have minimum window width:  oh well

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.01:  initial public release
  - 1.02:  fixed cut-and-paste error in usage screen (oops...)
  - 1.03:  modified to allow abbreviated options
  - 1.04:  removed bogus extra argument from usage fprintf() [Glenn R-P?];

 rpng2 - progressive-model PNG display program                  rpng2-x.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG files progressively, as if it were
 a web browser (though the front end is only set up to read from files).
 It supports gamma correction, user-specified background colors, and user-
 specified background patterns (for transparent images).  This version is
 for the X Window System (tested by the author under Unix and by Martin
 Zinser under OpenVMS; may work under OS/2 with a little tweaking).

 Thanks to Adam Costello and Pieter S. van der Meulen for the "diamond"
 and "radial waves" patterns, respectively.

 to do (someday, maybe):
  - fix expose/redraw code:  don't draw entire row if only part exposed
  - 8-bit (colormapped) X support
  - finish resizable checkerboard-gradient (sizes 4-128?)
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 wpng - simple PNG-writing program                                 wpng.c

 This program converts certain NetPBM binary files (grayscale and RGB,
 maxval = 255) to PNG.  Non-interlaced PNGs are written progressively;
 interlaced PNGs are read and written in one memory-intensive blast.

 Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly for providing the necessary trick to read
 interactive text from the keyboard while stdin is redirected.  Thanks
 to Cosmin Truta for Cygwin fixes.

 NOTE:  includes provisional support for PNM type "8" (portable alphamap)
        images, presumed to be a 32-bit interleaved RGBA format; no pro-
        vision for possible interleaved grayscale+alpha (16-bit) format.
        THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL NETPBM ALPHA FORMAT!

 to do:
  - delete output file if quit before calling any writepng routines
  - process backspace with -text option under DOS/Win? (currently get ^H)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.01:  initial public release
  - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options
  - 1.03:  removed extraneous character from usage screen; fixed bug in
            command-line parsing
  - 1.04:  fixed DOS/OS2/Win32 detection, including partial Cygwin fix
            (see http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/diffs/GregBook_cygwin.diff)
  - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
  - 2.01:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

      [REPORTED BUG (win32 only):  "contrib/gregbook/wpng.c - cmd line
       dose not work!  In order to do something useful I needed to redirect
       both input and output, with cygwin and with bcc32 as well.  Under
       Linux, the same wpng appears to work fine.  I don't know what is
       the problem."]

Generate a set of PNG test images.  The images are generated in a
sub-directory called 'tests' by default, however a command line argument will
change that name.  The generation requires a built version of makepng in the
current directory.

Make a test PNG image.  The arguments are as follows:

   makepng [--sRGB|--linear|--1.8] [--tRNS] [--nofilters] \
      color-type bit-depth [file-name]

The color-type may be numeric (and must match the numbers used by the PNG
specification) or one of the format names listed below.  The bit-depth is the
component bit depth, or the pixel bit-depth for a color-mapped image.

Without any options no color-space information is written, with the options
an sRGB or the appropriate gAMA chunk is written.  "1.8" refers to the
display system used on older Apple computers to correct for high ambient
light levels in the viewing environment; it applies a transform of
approximately value^(1/1.45) to the color values and so a gAMA chunk of 65909
is written (1.45/2.2).

The image data is generated internally.  Unless --color is given the images
used are as follows:

1 channel: a square image with a diamond, the least luminous colors are on
   the edge of the image, the most luminous in the center.

2 channels: the color channel increases in luminosity from top to bottom, the
   alpha channel increases in opacity from left to right.

3 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
   black, green, white, red.

4 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
   transparent, red, green, blue.

For color-mapped images a four channel color-map is used and if --tRNS is
given the PNG file has a tRNS chunk, as follows:

1-bit: entry 0 is transparent-red, entry 1 is opaque-white
2-bit: entry 0: transparent-green
       entry 1: 40%-red
       entry 2: 80%-blue
       entry 3: opaque-white
4-bit: the 16 combinations of the 2-bit case
8-bit: the 256 combinations of the 4-bit case

The palette always has 2^bit-depth entries and the tRNS chunk one fewer.  The
image is the 1-channel diamond, but using palette index, not luminosity.

For formats other than color-mapped ones if --tRNS is specified a tRNS chunk
is generated with all channels equal to the low bits of 0x0101.

Image size is determined by the final pixel depth in bits, i.e. channels x
bit-depth, as follows:

8 bits or less:    64x64
16 bits:           256x256
More than 16 bits: 1024x1024

Row filtering is the libpng default but may be turned off (the 'none' filter
is used on every row) with the --nofilters option.

The images are not interlaced.

If file-name is given then the PNG is written to that file, else it is
written to stdout.  Notice that stdout is not supported on systems where, by
default, it assumes text output; this program makes no attempt to change the
text mode of stdout!

   makepng --color=<color> ...

If --color is given then the whole image has that color, color-mapped images
will have exactly one palette entry and all image files with be 16x16 in
size.  The color value is 1 to 4 decimal numbers as appropriate for the color
type.

   makepng --small ...

If --small is given the images are no larger than required to include every
possible pixel value for the format.

For formats with pixels 8 bits or fewer in size the images consist of a
single row with 2^pixel-depth pixels, one of every possible value.

For formats with 16-bit pixels a 256x256 image is generated containing every
possible pixel value.

For larger pixel sizes a 256x256 image is generated where the first row
consists of each pixel that has identical byte values throughout the pixel
followed by rows where the byte values differ within the pixel.

In all cases the pixel values are arranged in such a way that the SUB and UP
filters give byte sequences for maximal zlib compression.  By default (if
--nofilters is not given) the SUB filter is used on the first row and the UP
filter on all following rows.

The --small option is meant to provide good test-case coverage, however the
images are not easy to examine visually.  Without the --small option the
images contain identical color values; the pixel values are adjusted
according to the gamma encoding with no gamma encoding being interpreted as
sRGB.

NOTES:
  This is a C program that is intended to be linked against libpng.  It
  allows the libpng unknown handling code to be tested by interpreting
  arguments to save or discard combinations of chunks.  The program is
  currently just a minimal validation for the built-in libpng facilities.

NOTES:
  This is a C program that is intended to be linked against libpng.  It
  generates bitmaps internally, stores them as PNG files (using the
  sequential write code) then reads them back (using the sequential
  read code) and validates that the result has the correct data.

  The program can be modified and extended to test the correctness of
  transformations performed by libpng.

Load an arbitrary number of PNG files (from the command line, or, if there
are no arguments on the command line, from stdin) then run a time test by
reading each file by row.  The test does nothing with the read result and
does no transforms.  The only output is a time as a floating point number of
seconds with 9 decimal digits.

This code must be linked against a math library (-lm), but does not require

Generate a PNG with an alpha channel, correctly.

This is a test case generator; the resultant PNG files are only of interest
to those of us who care about whether the edges of circles are green, red,
or yellow.

The program generates an RGB+Alpha PNG of a given size containing the given
shapes on a transparent background:

 genpng width height { shape }
   shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2

'color' is:

 black white red green yellow blue brown purple pink orange gray cyan

The point is to have colors that are linguistically meaningful plus that old
bugbear of the department store dress murders, Cyan, the only color we argue
about.

'shape' is:

 circle: an ellipse
 square: a rectangle
 line: a straight line

Each shape is followed by four numbers, these are two points in the output
coordinate space (as real numbers) which describe the circle, square, or
line.  The shape is filled if it is preceded by 'filled' (not valid for
'line') or is drawn with a line, in which case the width of the line must
precede the shape.

The whole set of information can be repeated as many times as desired:

   shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2

   color ::= black|white|red|green|yellow|blue
   color ::= brown|purple|pink|orange|gray|cyan
   width ::= filled
   width ::= <number>
   shape ::= circle|square|line
   x1    ::= <number>
   x2    ::= <number>
   y1    ::= <number>
   y2    ::= <number>

The output PNG is generated by down-sampling a 4x supersampled image using
a bi-cubic filter.  The bi-cubic has a 2 (output) pixel width, so an 8x8
array of super-sampled points contribute to each output pixel.  The value of
a super-sampled point is found using an unfiltered, aliased, infinite
precision image: Each shape from the last to the first is checked to see if
the point is in the drawn area and, if it is, the color of the point is the
color of the shape and the alpha is 1, if not the previous shape is checked.

This is an aliased algorithm because no filtering is done; a point is either
inside or outside each shape and 'close' points do not contribute to the
sample.  The down-sampling is relied on to correct the error of not using
a filter.

The line end-caps are 'flat'; they go through the points.  The square line
joins are mitres; the outside of the lines are continued to the point of
intersection.

Usage:

    png-fix-itxt < bad.png > good.png

Fixes a PNG file written with libpng-1.6.0 or 1.6.1 that has one or more
uncompressed iTXt chunks.  Assumes that the actual length is greater
than or equal to the value in the length byte, and that the CRC is
correct for the actual length.  This program hunts for the CRC and
adjusts the length byte accordingly.  It is not an error to process a
PNG file that has no iTXt chunks or one that has valid iTXt chunks;
such files will simply be copied.

Requires zlib (for crc32 and Z_NULL); build with

    gcc -O -o png-fix-itxt png-fix-itxt.c -lz

If you need to handle iTXt chunks larger than 500000 kbytes you must
rebuild png-fix-itxt with a larger values of MAX_LENGTH (or a smaller value
if you know you will never encounter such huge iTXt chunks).

cexcept.h 2.0.1 (2008-Jul-19-Sat)
http://www.nicemice.net/cexcept/
Adam M. Costello
http://www.nicemice.net/amc/

An interface for exception-handling in ANSI C (C89 and subsequent ISO
standards), developed jointly with Cosmin Truta.

    Copyright (c) 2000-2008 Adam M. Costello and Cosmin Truta.
    This software may be modified only if its author and version
    information is updated accurately, and may be redistributed
    only if accompanied by this unaltered notice.  Subject to those
    restrictions, permission is granted to anyone to do anything
    with this software.  The copyright holders make no guarantees
    regarding this software, and are not responsible for any damage
    resulting from its use.

The cexcept interface is not compatible with and cannot interact
with system exceptions (like division by zero or memory segmentation
violation), compiler-generated exceptions (like C++ exceptions), or
other exception-handling interfaces.

When using this interface across multiple .c files, do not include
this header file directly.  Instead, create a wrapper header file that
includes this header file and then invokes the define_exception_type
macro (see below).  The .c files should then include that header file.

The interface consists of one type, one well-known name, and six macros.


define_exception_type(type_name);

    This macro is used like an external declaration.  It specifies
    the type of object that gets copied from the exception thrower to
    the exception catcher.  The type_name can be any type that can be
    assigned to, that is, a non-constant arithmetic type, struct, union,
    or pointer.  Examples:

        define_exception_type(int);

        enum exception { out_of_memory, bad_arguments, disk_full };
        define_exception_type(enum exception);

        struct exception { int code; const char *msg; };
        define_exception_type(struct exception);

    Because throwing an exception causes the object to be copied (not
    just once, but twice), programmers may wish to consider size when
    choosing the exception type.


struct exception_context;

    This type may be used after the define_exception_type() macro has
    been invoked.  A struct exception_context must be known to both
    the thrower and the catcher.  It is expected that there be one
    context for each thread that uses exceptions.  It would certainly
    be dangerous for multiple threads to access the same context.
    One thread can use multiple contexts, but that is likely to be
    confusing and not typically useful.  The application can allocate
    this structure in any way it pleases--automatic, static, or dynamic.
    The application programmer should pretend not to know the structure
    members, which are subject to change.


struct exception_context *the_exception_context;

    The Try/Catch and Throw statements (described below) implicitly
    refer to a context, using the name the_exception_context.  It is
    the application's responsibility to make sure that this name yields
    the address of a mutable (non-constant) struct exception_context
    wherever those statements are used.  Subject to that constraint, the
    application may declare a variable of this name anywhere it likes
    (inside a function, in a parameter list, or externally), and may
    use whatever storage class specifiers (static, extern, etc) or type
    qualifiers (const, volatile, etc) it likes.  Examples:

        static struct exception_context
          * const the_exception_context = &foo;

        { struct exception_context *the_exception_context = bar; ... }

        int blah(struct exception_context *the_exception_context, ...);

        extern struct exception_context the_exception_context[1];

    The last example illustrates a trick that avoids creating a pointer
    object separate from the structure object.

    The name could even be a macro, for example:

        struct exception_context ec_array[numthreads];
        #define the_exception_context (ec_array + thread_id)

    Be aware that the_exception_context is used several times by the
    Try/Catch/Throw macros, so it shouldn't be expensive or have side
    effects.  The expansion must be a drop-in replacement for an
    identifier, so it's safest to put parentheses around it.


void init_exception_context(struct exception_context *ec);

    For context structures allocated statically (by an external
    definition or using the "static" keyword), the implicit
    initialization to all zeros is sufficient, but contexts allocated
    by other means must be initialized using this macro before they
    are used by a Try/Catch statement.  It does no harm to initialize
    a context more than once (by using this macro on a statically
    allocated context, or using this macro twice on the same context),
    but a context must not be re-initialized after it has been used by a
    Try/Catch statement.


Try statement
Catch (expression) statement

    The Try/Catch/Throw macros are capitalized in order to avoid
    confusion with the C++ keywords, which have subtly different
    semantics.

    A Try/Catch statement has a syntax similar to an if/else statement,
    except that the parenthesized expression goes after the second
    keyword rather than the first.  As with if/else, there are two
    clauses, each of which may be a simple statement ending with a
    semicolon or a brace-enclosed compound statement.  But whereas
    the else clause is optional, the Catch clause is required.  The
    expression must be a modifiable lvalue (something capable of being
    assigned to) of the same type (disregarding type qualifiers) that
    was passed to define_exception_type().

    If a Throw that uses the same exception context as the Try/Catch is
    executed within the Try clause (typically within a function called
    by the Try clause), and the exception is not caught by a nested
    Try/Catch statement, then a copy of the exception will be assigned
    to the expression, and control will jump to the Catch clause.  If no
    such Throw is executed, then the assignment is not performed, and
    the Catch clause is not executed.

    The expression is not evaluated unless and until the exception is
    caught, which is significant if it has side effects, for example:

        Try foo();
        Catch (p[++i].e) { ... }

    IMPORTANT: Jumping into or out of a Try clause (for example via
    return, break, continue, goto, longjmp) is forbidden--the compiler
    will not complain, but bad things will happen at run-time.  Jumping
    into or out of a Catch clause is okay, and so is jumping around
    inside a Try clause.  In many cases where one is tempted to return
    from a Try clause, it will suffice to use Throw, and then return
    from the Catch clause.  Another option is to set a flag variable and
    use goto to jump to the end of the Try clause, then check the flag
    after the Try/Catch statement.

    IMPORTANT: The values of any non-volatile automatic variables
    changed within the Try clause are undefined after an exception is
    caught.  Therefore, variables modified inside the Try block whose
    values are needed later outside the Try block must either use static
    storage or be declared with the "volatile" type qualifier.


Throw expression;

    A Throw statement is very much like a return statement, except that
    the expression is required.  Whereas return jumps back to the place
    where the current function was called, Throw jumps back to the Catch
    clause of the innermost enclosing Try clause.  The expression must
    be compatible with the type passed to define_exception_type().  The
    exception must be caught, otherwise the program may crash.

    Slight limitation:  If the expression is a comma-expression, it must
    be enclosed in parentheses.


Try statement
Catch_anonymous statement

    When the value of the exception is not needed, a Try/Catch statement
    can use Catch_anonymous instead of Catch (expression).


Everything below this point is for the benefit of the compiler.  The
application programmer should pretend not to know any of it, because it
is subject to change.

example.c

This is an example of how to use libpng to read and write PNG files.
The file libpng-manual.txt is much more verbose then this.  If you have
not read it, do so first.  This was designed to be a starting point of an
implementation.  This is not officially part of libpng, is hereby placed
in the public domain, and therefore does not require a copyright notice.

This file does not currently compile, because it is missing certain
parts, like allocating memory to hold an image.  You will have to
supply these parts to get it to compile.  For an example of a minimal
working PNG reader/writer, see pngtest.c, included in this distribution;

## Files:
ltmain.sh

This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
of too.

For the simplest scripts you might need only:

  #!/bin/sh
  . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
  . relative/path/to/options-parser
  scriptversion=1.0
  func_options ${1+"$@"}
  eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
  ...rest of your script...

In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# Copyright'.

For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
'# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.

The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
'--verbose'.

After sourcing this file, you can plug in processing for additional
options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
section further down.


## Files:
ltmain.sh

func_version
------------
Echo version message to standard output and exit.
The version message is extracted from the calling file's header
comments, with leading '# ' stripped:
  1. First display the progname and version
  2. Followed by the header comment line matching  /^# Written by /
  3. Then a blank line followed by the first following line matching
     /^# Copyright /
  4. Immediately followed by any lines between the previous matches,
     except lines preceding the intervening completely blank line.
For example, see the header comments of this file.

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owners

the Copyright owners claim "common-law trademark protection" in any

## Files:
png.h

A "png_get_copyright" function is available, for convenient use in "about"
boxes and the like:

   printf("%s", png_get_copyright(NULL));

Also, the PNG logo (in PNG format, of course) is supplied in the
files "pngbar.png" and "pngbar.jpg (88x31) and "pngnow.png" (98x31).


## Files:
png.h

With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
encoded PNG file is written.

With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
with at least image->colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.

With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
channels.

Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.

and license in png.h

This program reads in a PNG image, writes it out again, and then
compares the two files.  If the files are identical, this shows that
the basic chunk handling, filtering, and (de)compression code is working
properly.  It does not currently test all of the transforms, although
it probably should.

The program will report "FAIL" in certain legitimate cases:
1) when the compression level or filter selection method is changed.
2) when the maximum IDAT size (PNG_ZBUF_SIZE in pngconf.h) is not 8192.
3) unknown unsafe-to-copy ancillary chunks or unknown critical chunks
   exist in the input file.
4) others not listed here...
In these cases, it is best to check with another tool such as "pngcheck"
to see what the differences between the two files are.

If a filename is given on the command-line, then this file is used
for the input, rather than the default "pngtest.png".  This allows
testing a wide variety of files easily.  You can also test a number
of files at once by typing "pngtest -m file1.png file2.png ..."
