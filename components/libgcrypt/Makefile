# GCC 5.3 with the default optimization -O3 (set via shared-macros.mk),
# inlines _gcry_cipher_ocb_get_l, double_block_cpy and double_block to
# _gcry_cipher_ocb_authenticate on amd64. Due to a bug in GCC, the
# inlined code is incorrect and the library produces data with errors
# (manifested through failed 'basic' test results).  The optimization is
# lowered down on the affected platform.  For more information see:

# patching in a potentially dangerous area would be needed to allow use
