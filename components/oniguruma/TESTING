### Oniguruma - LIBRARY TEST ###

# If we upgrade oniguruma library, all the components
# using this library has to be rebuilt and tested.
# Currently, it is only the text/jq component.

### TEST - text/jq component ###

# Check that you have installed the latest oniguruma library.
> pkg info oniguruma | grep Version
          Version: 6.8.2

# Create userland workspace (https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland)
# on your local machine and enter jq component directory.
> cd $(YOUR_WORKSPACE)/components/jq/

# Compile text/jq component and run tests.
# If the compilation fails, oniguruma API probably changed.
# If some tests do not pass, a regression probably occurred.
> gmake build test

# Check that component text/jq is really linked to the right version of shared library.
# From the following output, it can be seen that the right
