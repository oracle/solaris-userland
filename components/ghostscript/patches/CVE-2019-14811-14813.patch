Subject: make .forceput inaccessible
X-Git-Url: http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=885444fcbe10dc42787ecb76686c8ee4dd33bf33

make .forceput inaccessible

Bug #701343, #701344, #701345

More defensive programming. We don't want people to access .forecput
even though it is no longer sufficient to bypass SAFER. The exploit
in #701343 didn't work anyway because of earlier work to stop the error
handler being used, but nevertheless, prevent access to .forceput from
.setuserparams2.
