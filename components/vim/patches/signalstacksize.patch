This patch works around an issue with vim dumping core with SIGSEGV when
handling a more benign signal (typically SIGHUP or SIGTERM). Vim tries to
run all the exit-vim autocommands, which end up busting the alternate stack
at its default size. Increasing the default seems to do the trick, but it
continues to be just a guess. The default stack size is not enough for vim.
