VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
          the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
          (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
          must make your changes, including source code, available to the
          maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
          include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
          maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
          will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
          then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
          The current maintainers are listed here: https://github.com/orgs/vim/people.
          If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
          vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely
          impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
          your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
          received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
          mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
          unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
          text under a) applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
          the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
          context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
          add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
          making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
          under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
          changes if the following three conditions are met:
          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of Vim without fee or restriction.
          - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
            or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
            any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
            available to him.
          - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
            contact information must remain valid for at least three years
            after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
            as possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
          you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
          any later version.
    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes.
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@vim.org>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option.

General changes made to netrw:

```
	v172:	Sep 02, 2021	* (Bram Moolenaar) Changed "l:go" to "go"
				* (Bram Moolenaar) no need for "b" in
				  netrw-safe guioptions
		Nov 15, 2021	* removed netrw_localrm and netrw_localrmdir
				  references
		Aug 18, 2022	* (Miguel Barro) improving compatibility with
				  powershell
	v171:	Oct 09, 2020	* included code in s:NetrwOptionsSafe()
				  to allow |'bh'| to be set to delete when
				  rather than hide when g:netrw_fastbrowse
				  was zero.
				* Installed |g:netrw_clipboard| setting
				* Installed option bypass for |'guioptions'|
				  a/A settings
				* Changed popup_beval() to |popup_atcursor()|
				  in netrw#ErrorMsg (lacygoill). Apparently
				  popup_beval doesn't reliably close the
				  popup when the mouse is moved.
				* VimEnter() now using win_execute to examine
				  buffers for an attempt to open a directory.
				  Avoids issues with popups/terminal from
				  command line. (lacygoill)
		Jun 28, 2021	* (zeertzjq) provided a patch for use of
				  xmap,xno instead of vmap,vno in
				  netrwPlugin.vim. Avoids entanglement with
				  select mode.
		Jul 14, 2021	* Fixed problem addressed by tst976; opening
				  a file using tree mode, going up a
				  directory, and opening a file there was
				  opening the file in the wrong directory.
		Jul 28, 2021	* (Ingo Karkat) provided a patch fixing an
				  E488 error with netrwPlugin.vim
				  (occurred for vim versions < 8.02)
	v170:	Mar 11, 2020	* (reported by Reiner Herrmann) netrw+tree
				  would not hide with the ^\..* pattern
				  correctly.
				* (Marcin Szamotulski) NetrwOptionRestore
				  did not restore options correctly that
				  had a single quote in the option string.
		Apr 13, 2020	* implemented error handling via popup
				  windows (see |popup_beval()|)
		Apr 30, 2020	* (reported by Manatsu Takahashi) while
				  using Lexplore, a modified file could
				  be overwritten.  Sol'n: will not overwrite,
				  but will emit an |E37| (although one cannot
				  add an ! to override)
		Jun 07, 2020	* (reported by Jo Totland) repeatedly invoking
				  :Lexplore and quitting it left unused
				  hidden buffers.  Netrw will now set netrw
				  buffers created by :Lexplore to |'bh'|=wipe.
	v169:	Dec 20, 2019	* (reported by amkarthik) that netrw's x
				  (|netrw-x|) would throw an error when
				  attempting to open a local directory.
	v168:	Dec 12, 2019	* scp timeout error message not reported,
				  hopefully now fixed (Shane Xb Qian)
	v167:	Nov 29, 2019	* netrw does a save&restore on @* and @+.
				  That causes problems with the clipboard.
				  Now restores occurs only if @* or @+ have
				  been changed.
				* netrw will change @* or @+ less often.
				  Never if I happen to have caught all the
				  operations that modify the unnamed
				  register (which also writes @*).
				* Modified hiding behavior so that "s"
				  will not ignore hiding.
	v166:	Nov 06, 2019	* Removed a space from a nmap for "-"
				* Numerous debugging statement changes
	v163:	Dec 05, 2017	* (Cristi Balan) reported that a setting ('sel')
				  was left changed
				* (Holger Mitschke) reported a problem with
				  saving and restoring history.  Fixed.
				* Hopefully I fixed a nasty bug that caused a
				  file rename to wipe out a buffer that it
				  should not have wiped out.
				* (Holger Mitschke) amended this help file
				  with additional |g:netrw_special_syntax|
				  items
				* Prioritized wget over curl for
				  g:netrw_http_cmd
	v162:	Sep 19, 2016	* (haya14busa) pointed out two syntax errors
				  with a patch; these are now fixed.
		Oct 26, 2016	* I started using mate-terminal and found that
				  x and gx (|netrw-x| and |netrw-gx|) were no
				  longer working.  Fixed (using atril when
				  $DESKTOP_SESSION is "mate").
		Nov 04, 2016	* (Martin Vuille) pointed out that @+ was
				  being restored with keepregstar rather than
				  keepregplus.
		Nov 09, 2016	* Broke apart the command from the options,
				  mostly for Windows.  Introduced new netrw
				  settings: |g:netrw_localcopycmdopt|
				  |g:netrw_localcopydircmdopt|
				  |g:netrw_localmkdiropt|
				  |g:netrw_localmovecmdopt|
		Nov 21, 2016	* (mattn) provided a patch for preview; swapped
				  winwidth() with winheight()
		Nov 22, 2016	* (glacambre) reported that files containing
				  spaces weren't being obtained properly via
				  scp.  Fix: apparently using single quotes
				  such as with 'file name' wasn't enough; the
				  spaces inside the quotes also had to be
				  escaped (ie. 'file\ name').
				* Also fixed obtain (|netrw-O|) to be able to
				  obtain files with spaces in their names
		Dec 20, 2016	* (xc1427) Reported that using "I" (|netrw-I|)
				  when atop "Hiding" in the banner also caused
				  the active-banner hiding control to occur
		Jan 03, 2017	* (Enno Nagel) reported that attempting to
				  apply netrw to a directory that was without
				  read permission caused a syntax error.
		Jan 13, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) provided a patch which makes
				  using netrw#Call() better.  Now returns
				  value of internal routines return, for example.
		Jan 13, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) changed netrw#FileUrlRead to
				  use |:edit| instead of |:read|.  I also
				  changed the routine name to netrw#FileUrlEdit.
		Jan 16, 2017	* (Sayem) reported a problem where :Lexplore
				  could generate a new listing buffer and
				  window instead of toggling the netrw display.
				  Unfortunately, the directions for eliciting
				  the problem weren't complete, so I may or
				  may not have fixed that issue.
		Feb 06, 2017	* Implemented cb and cB.  Changed "c" to "cd".
				  (see |netrw-cb|, |netrw-cB|, and |netrw-cd|)
		Mar 21, 2017	* previously, netrw would specify (safe) settings
				  even when the setting was already safe for
				  netrw.  Netrw now attempts to leave such
				  already-netrw-safe settings alone.
				  (affects s:NetrwOptionRestore() and
				  s:NetrwSafeOptions(); also introduced
				  s:NetrwRestoreSetting())
		Jun 26, 2017	* (Christian Brabandt) provided a patch to
				  allow curl to follow redirects (ie. -L
				  option)
		Jun 26, 2017	* (Callum Howard) reported a problem with
				  :Lexpore not removing the Lexplore window
				  after a change-directory
		Aug 30, 2017	* (Ingo Karkat) one cannot switch to the
				  previously edited file (e.g. with CTRL-^)
				  after editing a file:// URL.  Patch to
				  have a "keepalt" included.
		Oct 17, 2017	* (Adam Faryna) reported that gn (|netrw-gn|)
				  did not work on directories in the current
				  tree
	v157:	Apr 20, 2016	* (Nicola) had set up a "nmap <expr> ..." with
				  a function that returned a 0 while silently
				  invoking a shell command.  The shell command
				  activated a ShellCmdPost event which in turn
				  called s:LocalBrowseRefresh().  That looks
				  over all netrw buffers for changes needing
				  refreshes.  However, inside a |:map-<expr>|,
				  tab and window changes are disallowed.  Fixed.
				  (affects netrw's s:LocalBrowseRefresh())
				* g:netrw_localrmdir not used any more, but
				  the relevant patch that causes |delete()| to
				  take over was #1107 (not #1109).
				* |expand()| is now used on |g:netrw_home|;
				  consequently, g:netrw_home may now use
				  environment variables
				* s:NetrwLeftmouse and s:NetrwCLeftmouse will
				  return without doing anything if invoked
				  when inside a non-netrw window
		Jun 15, 2016	* gx now calls netrw#GX() which returns
				  the word under the cursor.  The new
				  wrinkle: if one is in a netrw buffer,
				  then netrw's s:NetrwGetWord().
		Jun 22, 2016	* Netrw was executing all its associated
				  Filetype commands silently; I'm going
				  to try doing that "noisily" and see if
				  folks have a problem with that.
		Aug 12, 2016	* Changed order of tool selection for
				  handling http://... viewing.
				  (Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pavlov)
		Aug 21, 2016	* Included hiding/showing/all for tree
				  listings
				* Fixed refresh (^L) for tree listings
	v156:	Feb 18, 2016	* Changed =~ to =~# where appropriate
		Feb 23, 2016	* s:ComposePath(base,subdir) now uses
				  fnameescape() on the base portion
		Mar 01, 2016	* (gt_macki) reported where :Explore would
				  make file unlisted. Fixed (tst943)
		Apr 04, 2016	* (reported by John Little) netrw normally
				  suppresses browser messages, but sometimes
				  those "messages" are what is wanted.
				  See |g:netrw_suppress_gx_mesg|
		Apr 06, 2016	* (reported by Carlos Pita) deleting a remote
				  file was giving an error message.  Fixed.
		Apr 08, 2016	* (Charles Cooper) had a problem with an
				  undefined b:netrw_curdir.  He also provided
				  a fix.
		Apr 20, 2016	* Changed s:NetrwGetBuffer(); now uses
				  dictionaries.  Also fixed the "No Name"
				  buffer problem.
	v155:	Oct 29, 2015	* (Timur Fayzrakhmanov) reported that netrw's
				  mapping of ctrl-l was not allowing refresh of
				  other windows when it was done in a netrw
				  window.
		Nov 05, 2015	* Improved s:TreeSqueezeDir() to use search()
				  instead of a loop
				* NetrwBrowse() will return line to
				  w:netrw_bannercnt if cursor ended up in
				  banner
		Nov 16, 2015	* Added a <Plug>NetrwTreeSqueeze (|netrw-s-cr|)
		Nov 17, 2015	* Commented out imaps -- perhaps someone can
				  tell me how they're useful and should be
				  retained?
		Nov 20, 2015	* Added |netrw-ma| and |netrw-mA| support
		Nov 20, 2015	* gx (|netrw-gx|) on a URL downloaded the
				  file in addition to simply bringing up the
				  URL in a browser.  Fixed.
		Nov 23, 2015	* Added |g:netrw_sizestyle| support
		Nov 27, 2015	* Inserted a lot of <c-u>s into various netrw
				  maps.
		Jan 05, 2016	* |netrw-qL| implemented to mark files based
				  upon |location-list|s; similar to |netrw-qF|.
		Jan 19, 2016	* using - call delete(directoryname,"d") -
				  instead of using g:netrw_localrmdir if
				  v7.4 + patch#1107 is available
		Jan 28, 2016	* changed to using |winsaveview()| and
				  |winrestview()|
		Jan 28, 2016	* s:NetrwTreePath() now does a save and
				  restore of view
		Feb 08, 2016	* Fixed a tree-listing problem with remote
				  directories
	v154:	Feb 26, 2015	* (Yuri Kanivetsky) reported a situation where
				  a file was not treated properly as a file
				  due to g:netrw_keepdir == 1
		Mar 25, 2015	* (requested by Ben Friz) one may now sort by
				  extension
		Mar 28, 2015	* (requested by Matt Brooks) netrw has a lot
				  of buffer-local mappings; however, some
				  plugins (such as vim-surround) set up
				  conflicting mappings that cause vim to wait.
				  The "<nowait>" modifier has been included
				  with most of netrw's mappings to avoid that
				  delay.
		Jun 26, 2015	* |netrw-gn| mapping implemented
				* :Ntree NotADir resulted in having
				  the tree listing expand in the error messages
				  window.  Fixed.
		Jun 29, 2015	* Attempting to delete a file remotely caused
				  an error with "keepsol" mentioned; fixed.
		Jul 08, 2015	* Several changes to keep the |:jumps| table
				  correct when working with
				  |g:netrw_fastbrowse| set to 2
				* wide listing with accented characters fixed
				  (using %-S instead of %-s with a |printf()|
		Jul 13, 2015	* (Daniel Hahler) CheckIfKde() could be true
				  but kfmclient not installed.  Changed order
				  in netrw#BrowseX(): checks if kde and
				  kfmclient, then will use xdg-open on a unix
				  system (if xdg-open is executable)
		Aug 11, 2015	* (McDonnell) tree listing mode wouldn't
				  select a file in a open subdirectory.
				* (McDonnell) when multiple subdirectories
				  were concurrently open in tree listing
				  mode, a ctrl-L wouldn't refresh properly.
				* The netrw:target menu showed duplicate
				  entries
		Oct 13, 2015	* (mattn) provided an exception to handle
				  windows with shellslash set but no shell
		Oct 23, 2015	* if g:netrw_usetab and <c-tab> now used
				  to control whether NetrwShrink is used
				  (see |netrw-c-tab|)
	v153:	May 13, 2014	* added another |g:netrw_ffkeep| usage {{{2
		May 14, 2014	* changed s:PerformListing() so that it
				  always sets ft=netrw for netrw buffers
				  (ie. even when syntax highlighting is
				  off, not available, etc)
		May 16, 2014	* introduced the |netrw-ctrl-r| functionality
		May 17, 2014	* introduced the |netrw-:NetrwMB| functionality
				* mb and mB (|netrw-mb|, |netrw-mB|) will
				  add/remove marked files from bookmark list
		May 20, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that :Lex <dirname>
				  wasn't working.  Fixed.
		May 26, 2014	* restored test to prevent leftmouse window
				  resizing from causing refresh.
				  (see s:NetrwLeftmouse())
				* fixed problem where a refresh caused cursor
				  to go just under the banner instead of
				  staying put
		May 28, 2014	* (László Bimba) provided a patch for opening
				  the |:Lexplore| window 100% high, optionally
				  on the right, and will work with remote
				  files.
		May 29, 2014	* implemented :NetrwC  (see |netrw-:NetrwC|)
		Jun 01, 2014	* Removed some "silent"s from commands used
				  to implemented scp://... and pscp://...
				  directory listing.  Permits request for
				  password to appear.
		Jun 05, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that user maps "/"
				  caused problems with "b" and "w", which
				  are mapped (for wide listings only) to
				  skip over files rather than just words.
		Jun 10, 2014	* |g:netrw_gx| introduced to allow users to
				  override default "<cfile>" with the gx
				  (|netrw-gx|) map
		Jun 11, 2014	* gx (|netrw-gx|), with |'autowrite'| set,

				  |'autowrite'| setting.
		Jun 13, 2014	* added visual map for gx use
		Jun 15, 2014	* (Enno Nagel) reported that with having hls

				  b and w maps caused unwanted highlighting.
		Jul 05, 2014	* |netrw-mv| and |netrw-mX| commands included
		Jul 09, 2014	* |g:netrw_keepj| included, allowing optional
				  keepj

		Jul 21, 2014	* (Bruno Sutic) provided an updated
				  netrw_gitignore.vim
		Jul 30, 2014	* (Yavuz Yetim) reported that editing two
				  remote files of the same name caused the
				  second instance to have a "temporary"
				  name.  Fixed: now they use the same buffer.
		Sep 18, 2014	* (Yasuhiro Matsumoto) provided a patch which
				  allows scp and windows local paths to work.
		Oct 07, 2014	* gx (see |netrw-gx|) when atop a directory,
				  will now do |gf| instead
		Nov 06, 2014	* For cygwin: cygstart will be available for
				  netrw#BrowseX() to use if its executable.
		Nov 07, 2014	* Began support for file://... urls.  Will use
				  |g:netrw_file_cmd| (typically elinks or links)

				  directories.  Works for linux machines,
				  cygwin+vim, but not for windows+gvim.
		Dec 02, 2014	* in tree mode, netrw was not opening
				  directories via symbolic links.
		Dec 02, 2014	* added resolved link information to
				  thin and tree modes
		Dec 30, 2014	* (issue#231) |:ls| was not showing

	v152:	Apr 08, 2014	* uses the |'noswapfile'| option (requires {{{2
				  vim 7.4 with patch 213)
				* (Enno Nagel) turn |'rnu'| off in netrw
				  buffers.
				* (Quinn Strahl) suggested that netrw
				  allow regular window splitting to occur,
				  thereby allowing |'equalalways'| to take
				  effect.
				* (qingtian zhao) normally, netrw will
				  save and restore the |'fileformat'|;
				  however, sometimes that isn't wanted
		Apr 14, 2014	* whenever netrw marks a buffer as ro,
				  it will also mark it as nomod.
		Apr 16, 2014	* sftp protocol now supported by
				  netrw#Obtain(); this means that one
				  may use "mc" to copy a remote file
				  to a local file using sftp, and that
				  the |netrw-O| command can obtain remote
				  files via sftp.
				* added [count]C support (see |netrw-C|)
		Apr 18, 2014	* when |g:netrw_chgwin| is one more than
				  the last window, then vertically split
				  the last window and use it as the
				  chgwin window.
		May 09, 2014	* SavePosn was "saving filename under cursor"
				  from a non-netrw window when using :Rex.
	v151:	Jan 22, 2014	* extended :Rexplore to return to buffer {{{2
				  prior to Explore or editing a directory
				* (Ken Takata) netrw gave error when
				  clipboard was disabled.  Sol'n: Placed
				  several if has("clipboard") tests in.
				* Fixed ftp://X@Y@Z// problem; X@Y now
				  part of user id, and only Z is part of
				  hostname.
				* (A Loumiotis) reported that completion
				  using a directory name containing spaces
				  did not work.  Fixed with a retry in
				  netrw#Explore() which removes the
				  backslashes vim inserted.
		Feb 26, 2014	* :Rexplore now records the current file
				   using w:netrw_rexfile when returning via
				  |:Rexplore|
		Mar 08, 2014	* (David Kotchan) provided some patches
				  allowing netrw to work properly with
				  windows shares.
				* Multiple one-liner help messages available
				  by pressing <cr> while atop the "Quick
				  Help" line
				* worked on ShellCmdPost, FocusGained event
				  handling.
				* |:Lexplore| path: will be used to update
				  a left-side netrw browsing directory.
		Mar 12, 2014	* |netrw-s-cr|: use <s-cr>  to close
				  tree directory implemented
		Mar 13, 2014	* (Tony Mechylynck) reported that using
				  the browser with ftp on a directory,
				  and selecting a gzipped txt file, that
				  an E19 occurred (which was issued by
				  gzip.vim).  Fixed.

				  and |netrw-:MT|, respectively)
		Mar 17, 2014	* |:Ntree| [dir] wasn't working properly; fixed
		Mar 18, 2014	* Changed all uses of set to setl
		Mar 18, 2014	* Commented the netrw_btkeep line in
				  s:NetrwOptionSave(); the effect is that
				  netrw buffers will remain as |'bt'|=nofile.
				  This should prevent swapfiles being created
				  for netrw buffers.
		Mar 20, 2014	* Changed all uses of lcd to use s:NetrwLcd()
				  instead.  Consistent error handling results
				  and it also handles Window's shares
				* Fixed |netrw-d| command when applied with ftp
				* https: support included for netrw#NetRead()
	v150:	Jul 12, 2013	* removed a "keepalt" to allow ":e #" to {{{2
				  return to the netrw directory listing
		Jul 13, 2013	* (Jonas Diemer) suggested changing
				  a <cWORD> to <cfile>.
		Jul 21, 2013	* (Yuri Kanivetsky) reported that netrw's
				  use of mkdir did not produce directories
				  following the user's umask.
		Aug 27, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_altfile| option
		Sep 05, 2013	* s:Strlen() now uses |strdisplaywidth()|
				  when available, by default
		Sep 12, 2013	* (Selyano Baldo) reported that netrw wasn't
				  opening some directories properly from the
				  command line.
		Nov 09, 2013	* |:Lexplore| introduced
				* (Ondrej Platek) reported an issue with
				  netrw's trees (P15).  Fixed.
				* (Jorge Solis) reported that "t" in
				  tree mode caused netrw to forget its
				  line position.
		Dec 05, 2013	* Added <s-leftmouse> file marking
				  (see |netrw-mf|)
		Dec 05, 2013	* (Yasuhiro Matsumoto) Explore should use
				  strlen() instead s:Strlen() when handling
				  multibyte chars with strpart()
				  (ie. strpart() is byte oriented, not
				  display-width oriented).
		Dec 09, 2013	* (Ken Takata) Provided a patch; File sizes
				  and a portion of timestamps were wrongly
				  highlighted with the directory color when
				  setting `:let g:netrw_liststyle=1` on Windows.
				* (Paul Domaskis) noted that sometimes
				  cursorline was activating in non-netrw
				  windows.  All but one setting of cursorline
				  was done via setl; there was one that was
				  overlooked.  Fixed.
		Dec 24, 2013	* (esquifit) asked that netrw allow the
				  /cygdrive prefix be a user-alterable
				  parameter.
		Jan 02, 2014	* Fixed a problem with netrw-based ballon
				  evaluation (ie. netrw#NetrwBaloonHelp()
				  not having been loaded error messages)
		Jan 03, 2014	* Fixed a problem with tree listings
				* New command installed: |:Ntree|
		Jan 06, 2014	* (Ivan Brennan) reported a problem with
				  |netrw-P|.  Fixed.
		Jan 06, 2014	* Fixed a problem with |netrw-P| when the
				  modified file was to be abandoned.
		Jan 15, 2014	* (Matteo Cavalleri) reported that when the
				  banner is suppressed and tree listing is
				  used, a blank line was left at the top of
				  the display.  Fixed.
		Jan 20, 2014	* (Gideon Go) reported that, in tree listing
				  style, with a previous window open, that
				  the wrong directory was being used to open
				  a file.  Fixed. (P21)
	v149:	Apr 18, 2013	* in wide listing format, now have maps for {{{2
				  w and b to move to next/previous file
		Apr 26, 2013	* one may now copy files in the same
				  directory; netrw will issue requests for
				  what names the files should be copied under
		Apr 29, 2013	* Trying Benzinger's problem again.  Seems
				  that commenting out the BufEnter and
				  installing VimEnter (only) works.  Weird
				  problem!  (tree listing, vim -O Dir1 Dir2)
		May 01, 2013	* :Explore ftp://... wasn't working.  Fixed.
		May 02, 2013	* introduced |g:netrw_bannerbackslash| as
				  requested by Paul Domaskis.
		Jul 03, 2013	* Explore now avoids splitting when a buffer
				  will be hidden.
	v148:	Apr 16, 2013	* changed Netrw's Style menu to allow direct {{{2
				  choice of listing style, hiding style, and
				  sorting style

## Files:
runtime/spell/README.txt

The spell files included here are in Vim's special format.  You can't edit
them.  See ":help spell" for more information.


COPYRIGHT

The files used as input for the spell files come from the OpenOffice.org spell
files.  Most of them go under the LGPL or a similar license.

Copyright notices for specific languages are in README_??.txt.  Note that the
files for different regions are merged, both to save space and to make it
possible to highlight words for another region different from bad words.

Most of the soundslike mappings come from Aspell ??_phonet.dat files:
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/.  Most go under the GPL or LGPL copyright.


GENERATING .SPL FILES

This involves downloading the files from the github server, applying a
patch and running Vim to generate the .spl file.  To do this all in one go use
the Aap program (www.a-a-p.org).  It's simple to install, it only requires
Python (http://www.a-a-p.org/download.html)

Before generating spell files, verify your system has the required locale
support.  Source the check_locales.vim script to find out.  If something is
missing, see LOCALE below.


You can also do it manually:
1. Fetch the right spell file from:
   https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries

2. Unzip the archive:
	unzip LL_RR.zip

3. Apply the patch:
	patch < LL_RR.diff

4. If the language has multiple regions do the above for each region.  E.g.,
   for English there are five regions: US, CA, AU, NZ and GB.

5. Run Vim and execute ":mkspell".  Make sure you do this with the correct
   locale, that influences the upper/lower case letters and word characters.
   On Unix it's something like:
   	env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 vim
	mkspell! en en_US en_AU en_CA en_GB en_NZ

6. Repeat step 5 for other locales.  For English you could generate a spell
   file for latin1, utf-8 and ASCII.  ASCII only makes sense for languages
   that have very few words with non-ASCII letters.

Now you understand why I prefer using the Aap recipe :-).


MAINTAINING A LANGUAGE

Every language should have a maintainer.  His tasks are to track the changes
in the spell files and make updated patches.  Words that haven't been
added/removed from the LibreOffice lists can also be handled by the patches.

It is important to keep the version of the .dic and .aff files that you
started with.  When LibreOffice brings out new versions of these files you can
find out what changed and take over these changes in your patch.  When there
are very many changes you can do it the other way around: re-apply the changes
for Vim to the new versions of the .dic and .aff files.

This procedure should work well:

1. Obtain the zip archive with the .aff and .dic files.  Unpack it as
   explained above and copy (don't rename!) the .aff and .dic files to
   .orig.aff and .orig.dic.  Using the Aap recipe should work, it will make
   the copies for you.

2. Tweak the .aff and .dic files to generate the perfect .spl file.  Don't
   change too much, the OpenOffice people are not stupid.  However, you may
   want to remove obvious mistakes.  And remove single-letter words that
   aren't really words, they mess up the suggestions (English has this
   problem).  You can use the "fixdup.vim" Vim script to find duplicate words.

3. Include needed parts from the aspell phonetic dictionary to the aff files. For
   example add the relevant SAL lines to the .aff file (this is needed to make good
   suggestions). The aspell dictionaries can be found here:
   https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html

4. Make the diff file.  "aap diff" will do this for you.  If a diff would be
   too big you might consider writing a Vim script to do systematic changes.
   Do check that someone else can reproduce building the spell file.  Send the
   result to Bram for inclusion in the distribution.  Bram will generate the
   .spl file and upload it to the ftp server (if he can't generate it you will
   have to send him the .spl file too).

5. When OpenOffice makes a new zip file available you need to update the
   patch.  "aap check" should do most of the work for you: if there are
   changes the .new.dic and .new.aff files will appear.  You can now figure
   out the differences with .orig.dic and .orig.aff, adjust the .dic and .aff
   files and finally move the .new.dic to .orig.dic and .new.aff to .orig.aff.

6. Repeat step 5. regularly.


LOCALE

For proper spell file generation the required locale must be installed.
Otherwise Vim doesn't know what are letters and upper-lower case differences.
Modern systems use UTF-8, but we also generate spell files for 8-bit locales
for users with older systems.

On Ubuntu the default is to only support locales for your own language.  To
add others you need to do this:
	sudo vim /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
	    Add needed lines from /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

When using the check_locales.vim script, you need to exit Vim and restart it
to pickup the newly installed locales.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!




## Files:
src/xdiff/README.txt

The files in this directory come from the xdiff implementation in git.
You can find it here: https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/xdiff
The files were last updated March 17, 2023 from git release v.2.40.0

This is originally based on libxdiff, which can be found here:
http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html

The git version was used because it has been maintained and improved.
And since it's part of git it is expected to be reliable.

The code is distributed under the GNU LGPL license.  It is included in the
COPYING file.

Changes in these files were made to avoid compiler warnings.

The /* */ comments are kept to make syncing to a newer version easier, do not
change them to // comments!

The first work for including xdiff in Vim was done by Christian Brabandt.


## Files:
src/xpm/README.txt

This is XPM library compiled for Windows which is intended for use with Vim
'signs' feature.

Libraries in x86 directory were compiled with MSVC6 and MinGW. Proposed
commands to compile Vim are:

If you want to build XPM library by yourself, you may want to use the
following Win32 port:
https://github.com/koron/libXpm-win32

Any version of MSVC starting from version 6.0:
nmake -f Make_mvc.mak GUI=yes CSCOPE=yes NETBEANS=yes XPM=e:\hg\xpm\x86

MinGW:
mingw32-make -f Make_ming.mak GUI=yes CSCOPE=yes XPM=e:/hg/xpm/x86

MinGW 64 for x64:
mingw32-make -f Make_ming.mak GUI=yes ARCH=x86-64 XPM=E:\HG\xpm\x64

Microsoft Visual C++ on x64 (tested with versions 2008 and 2010):
nmake -f Make_mvc.mak GUI=yes CSCOPE=yes XPM=E:\HG\xpm\x64

To test, open some file in Vim and execute commands below:
:exe 'sign define vimxpm icon='.$VIMRUNTIME.'\\vim32x32.xpm'
:exe 'sign place 1 line=1 name=vimxpm file='.expand('%:p')


See COPYRIGHT for XPM licence.

 NOTICE:

 This is NOT the original regular expression code as written by Henry
 Spencer.  This code has been modified specifically for use with the VIM
 editor, and should not be used separately from Vim.  If you want a good
 regular expression library, get the original code.  The copyright notice
 that follows is from the original.

 tee.c - pipe fitting

 tee reads stdin, and writes what it reads to each of the specified
 files. The primary reason of existence for this version is a quick
 and dirty implementation to distribute with Vim, to make one of the
 most useful features of Vim possible on OS/2: quickfix.

 Of course, not using tee but instead redirecting make's output directly
 into a temp file and then processing that is possible, but if we have a
 system capable of correctly piping (unlike DOS, for example), why not
 use it as well as possible? This tee should also work on other systems,
 but it's not been tested there, only on OS/2.

 tee is also available in the GNU shellutils package, which is available
 precompiled for OS/2. That one probably works better.
