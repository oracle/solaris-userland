      And I experienced a sense that, like certain regular
      expressions, seemed to match the day from beginning to end, so
      that I did not need to identify the parenthesised subexpression
      that told of dawn, nor the group of characters that indicated
      the moment when my grandfather returned home with news of
      Swann's departure for Paris; and the whole length of the month
      of May, as if matched by a closure, fitted into the buffer of my
      life with no sign of overflowing, turning the days, like a
      procession of insects that could consist of this or that
      species, into a random and unstructured repetition of different
      sequences, anchored from the first day of the month to the last
      in the same fashion as the weeks when I knew I would not see
      Gilberte and would search in vain for any occurrences of the
      string in the avenue of hawthorns by Tansonville, without my
      having to delimit explicitly the start or finish of the pattern.
