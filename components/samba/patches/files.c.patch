Fixes:

Files do not appear on Samba shares on Solaris.
Only directories are visible.

When a client attempts to list a directory, Samba tries to open each file in
that directory, it uses an O_SEARCH flag passed as (a bit) an argument to
openat(). On Solaris 11, that flag is valid only for directories and when used
on regular files it results in a failure. The failure in Samba to open file
while listing directory makes all files in directories to disappear, they
don't show up on the client.

This is not an issue on Linux.
Linux doesn't implement O_SEARCH, it uses O_PATH instead.

As a workaround we drop the O_SEARCH completely (for both files / directories),
thus requiring +r bits on directories (+x is insufficient) for traversal.
This is likely how Samba worked in past.
