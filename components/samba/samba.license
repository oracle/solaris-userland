                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

About Samba
===========

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of
programs for Linux and Unix.
Samba is Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public License and
the Samba project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy.
Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS
and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.
Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix Servers and
Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can function both as a
domain controller or as a regular domain member.


For the AD DC implementation a full HOWTO is provided at:
      https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/HOWTO

Community guidelines can be read at:
      https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/How_to_do_Samba:_Nicely

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called COPYING).



CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

Please see https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Contribute
for detailed set-by-step instructions on how to submit a patch
for Samba via GitLab.

Samba's GitLab mirror is at https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba

OUR CONTRIBUTORS
================

See https://www.samba.org/samba/team/ for details of the Samba Team,
as well as details of all those currently active in Samba development.

If you like a particular feature then look through the git change-log
(on the web at https://gitweb.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=summary) and see
who added it, then send them an email.

Remember that free software of this kind lives or dies by the response
we get. If no one tells us they like it then we'll probably move onto
something else.


MORE INFO
=========

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

There is quite a bit of documentation included with the package,
including man pages and the wiki at https://wiki.samba.org

If you would like to help with our documentation, please contribute
that improved content to the wiki, we are moving as much content there
as possible.


MAILING LIST
------------

Please do NOT send subscription/unsubscription requests to the lists!

There is a mailing list for discussion of Samba.  For details go to
<https://lists.samba.org/> or send mail to <samba-subscribe@lists.samba.org>

There is also an announcement mailing list where new versions are
announced.  To subscribe go to <https://lists.samba.org/> or send mail
to <samba-announce-subscribe@lists.samba.org>.  All announcements also
go to the samba list, so you only need to be on one.

For details of other Samba mailing lists and for access to archives, see
<https://lists.samba.org/>


MAILING LIST ETIQUETTE
----------------------

A few tips when submitting to this or any mailing list.

1. Make your subject short and descriptive. Avoid the words "help" or
   "Samba" in the subject. The readers of this list already know that
   a) you need help, and b) you are writing about samba (of course,
   you may need to distinguish between Samba PDC and other file
   sharing software). Avoid phrases such as "what is" and "how do
   i". Some good subject lines might look like "Slow response with
   Excel files" or "Migrating from Samba PDC to NT PDC".

2. If you include the original message in your reply, trim it so that
   only the relevant lines, enough to establish context, are
   included. Chances are (since this is a mailing list) we've already
   read the original message.

3. Trim irrelevant headers from the original message in your
   reply. All we need to see is a) From, b) Date, and c) Subject. We
   don't even really need the Subject, if you haven't changed
   it. Better yet is to just preface the original message with "On
   [date] [someone] wrote:".

4. Please don't reply to or argue about spam, spam filters or viruses
   on any Samba lists. We do have a spam filtering system that is
   working quite well thank you very much but occasionally unwanted
   messages slip through. Deal with it.

5. Never say "Me too." It doesn't help anyone solve the
   problem. Instead, if you ARE having the same problem, give more
   information. Have you seen something that the other writer hasn't
   mentioned, which may be helpful?

6. If you ask about a problem, then come up with the solution on your
   own or through another source, by all means post it. Someone else
   may have the same problem and is waiting for an answer, but never
   hears of it.

7. Give as much *relevant* information as possible such as Samba
   release number, OS, kernel version, etc...

8. RTFM. Google.

examples/ad-bench/README

==========================
Active Directory benchmark
==========================

Setup
=====

You need to modify settings.sh to point to the correct binaries for your
platform. One thing you might want to do in order to be able to run the
benchmark as a non-root user is to compile your own samba version with the
--prefix configure option set to some location writeable by the user who will be
running the benchmark. You then need to point the NET variable to the correct
location.

Most likely, you will also want to put the realm to kdc hostname mappings into
krb5.conf and the hostname to IP address mappings for the kdcs to test into the
hosts file, so you actually benchmark the AD speed, not DNS lookup speed.

Running the benchmarks
======================

Per default, the benchmark looks for a file called runs.txt in the directory the
benchmark is run from. (This is configurable in the settings.sh file)
runs.txt contains the credentials and server names to connect to, one set of
credentials/server per line. The format is as follows:

user@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM%password:domain_controller_host_name

===================
CHANGES SINCE v0.7b
===================
included patch that made machine name %m a macro substitution value.
Thanks to:   Nick Lopez  <kimo_sabe@atdot.org>

==================
CHANGES SINCE v0.6
==================
PLEASE NOT THAT I AM CONSIDERING THIS A BETA UNTIL I GET SOME FEEDBACK
FROM USERS ON WHETHER THE MACRO FEATURE WORKS FOR THEM.

added the ability to define substitution macros: see the usage section

removed the large docstring from the file and moved the information to
the USAGE section of this file

cleaned up the code and made more flexible

improved the code comments

==================
CHANGES SINCE v0.5
==================
added a -v --version switch

added a --pause switch which will put a pause statement between each 
non-blank line of the script.

===============
A PERSONAL NOTE
===============
When I originally posted v0.5 on Freshmeat, I really expected *some*
feedback. To date this little script has been downloaded over 700 times, but
absolutely nobody has sent me an e-mail to tell me if it is useful, or if
it is absolutely the stupidest waste of bandwidth they have ever seen.
I'd really love to know if even one person other than me and the other techs
here at Avalon have found it useful.

Thanks.

Thanks to those that did respond to my plea! I'd still love to hear from 
any other users!

============
INTRODUCTION
============
As my experience with Linux and Samba increased, I had no trouble whipping up
a custom Perl, Python or Bash script to create Samba Logon Scripts, but I
noticed that I changed things from place to place, and that my users had *no*
chance of ever figuring out how to modify those scripts themselves.

In an attempt to create a company wide standard that both my co-workers and my
customers could *easily* modify I hit upon the scheme I used here.

I settled on an INI file feel, because most who have experience with Win boxes
have some concept of INI files.

============
INSTALLATION
============
The distribution archive contains three files:

README			This file
ntlogon.py		The actual Python script (place in /usr/local/samba/bin)
ntlogon.conf	A sample configuration file (place in /etc)

This script was created using Python v1.5.2, and I believe it uses only
standard libraries.

Your smb.conf file needs to contain a netlogon section similar to the 
following (These settings *are not* normal on a RH box. These settings
are all based on the excellent book that I learned Samba from: Samba
Integrating Unix and Windows by John D. Blair. It is somewhat out of 
date now, but that's the history of the strange file locations):

[netlogon]
        path = /usr/local/samba/netlogon
        writeable = no
        guest ok = no
        root preexec = /usr/local/samba/bin/ntlogon --user=%U  --os=%m
        root postexec = rm /usr/local/samba/netlogon/%U.bat

======
USAGE
======
PLEASE SEE NTLOGON.CONF FOR A DETAILED CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

This programme will build a Windows NT logon script for users connecting
to a Samba server. Samba macros that are currently understood:

   %U user name
   %G group name
   %a machine architecture
   %m machine netbios name

This programme reads a configuration that looks strikingly similar to both
the Samba configuration file, and a DOS "boot menu" AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The default file name is /etc/ntlogon.conf (though I really think it ought
to be called ntlogon.batch!) You may change the filename by using the -f
or --templatefile startup option.

The default netlogon directory is /usr/local/samba/netlogon though this
can be changed with the -d or --dir startup option.
                                              
The default batch file name generated is username.bat if no username is
specified the default value is logon.bat (e.g., if --user=fred is specified
on the command line then the logon script generated will be stored in 
fred.bat)

Use the --debug option to print the logon script to screen instead of the 
output file

Use the --pause option to place a pause statement between each line of the
script to assist in debugging a logon script.
 
The file is divided into sections that have headers in square brackets

[Global]
[User-username]
[Group-groupname]
[OS-osname]

The file may also contain user defined substitution macros. They are
defined by placing the macro name on the left side of an equal sign,
and the substitution text on the right side of the equal sign. They
are also case sensitive:

MAINDRIVE = G:
USERDRIVE = U:
SERVERNAME = myservername

They are referenced by prepending a "%" sign to the variable name:

NET USE %MAINDRIVE \\\\servername\\mainshare /YES
NET USE %USERDRIVE \\\\%SERVERNAME\\usershare /YES

==============
SPECIAL THANKS
==============
Nick Lopez <kimo_sabe@atdot.org> for the net bios name patch.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

The following files in the WindowsServerDocs folder have been sourced from a
Microsoft Github repository.

project: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/

License files (LICENSE and LICENSE-CODE) have also been included in the
./WindowsServerDocs directory for reference.


===============================================================================

The Schema updates file is taken from this repository:

file: WindowsServerDocs/identity/ad-ds/deploy/Schema-Updates.md

./WindowsServerDocs/Schema-Updates.md is our current version of the file
(last updated Jun 1, 2017, commit SHA f79755b75d2810b8a4).

The ms_schema_markdown.py script was then used to produce the .ldf files.

However, this schema didn't work. The ./WindowsServerDocs/*.diff files are the
changes we made on top of this to get the schema working on Samba. If you are
re-generating the .ldf files, to apply the patches, use:

for p in `ls WindowsServerDocs/*.diff` ; do patch -p 1 < $p ; done

All this is handled at runtime in the provision code, so that we do
not store patched generated files in git (an alternative would have
been to patch the original markdown).


===============================================================================

The Forest Wide updates file is taken from this repository:

file: WindowsServerDocs/identity/ad-ds/deploy/RODC/Forest-Wide-Updates.md

./WindowsServerDocs/Forest-Wide-Updates.md is our current version of the file
(last updated Dec 15, 2017, commit SHA f209fb9101ee87107).

The ms_forest_updates_markdown.py script is used to extract the add portions of
the updates. The rest are handled manually in forest_updates.py by interpreting
this documentation (as they are not as well-structured).

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

The format for the configuration file is as follows:

While there is some room for confusion, we attempt to process things in
order of specificity: Global first, Group second, User third, OS Type
forth. This order can be debated forever, but it seems to make the most
sense.

# Everything in the Global section applies to all users logging on to the
# network
[Global]
@ECHO "Welcome to our network!!!"
NET TIME \\\\servername /SET /YES
NET USE F: \\\\servername\\globalshare /YES

# Map the private user area in the global section so we don't have to
# create individual user entries for each user!
NET USE U: \\\\servername\\%U /YES

# Group entries, User entries and OS entries each start with the
# keyword followed by a dash followed by--appropriately enough the Group
# name, the User name, or the OS name.
[Group-admin]
@ECHO "Welcome administrators!"
NET USE G: \\\\servername\\adminshare1 /YES
NET USE I: \\\\servername\\adminshare2 /YES

[Group-peons]

 * Note: we use our own routines on platforms that don't HAVE_STRUCT_ADDRINFO,
 * whether or not the library routine getaddrinfo() can be found.  This
 * policy is needed because on some platforms a manually installed libbind.a
 * may provide getaddrinfo(), yet the system headers may not provide the
 * struct definitions needed to call it.  To avoid conflict with the libbind
 * definition in such cases, we rename our routines to pg_xxx() via macros.
 *

in lib/replace we use rep_xxx()

 * This code will also work on platforms where struct addrinfo is defined
 * in the system headers but no getaddrinfo() can be located.

Module name: params

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- **

 This module performs lexical analysis and initial parsing of a
 Windows-like parameter file.  It recognizes and handles four token
 types:  section-name, parameter-name, parameter-value, and
 end-of-file.  Comments and line continuation are handled
 internally.

 The entry point to the module is function pm_process().  This
 function opens the source file, calls the Parse() function to parse
 the input, and then closes the file when either the EOF is reached
 or a fatal error is encountered.

 A sample parameter file might look like this:

 [section one]
 parameter one = value string
 parameter two = another value
 [section two]
 new parameter = some value or t'other

 The parameter file is divided into sections by section headers:
 section names enclosed in square brackets (eg. [section one]).
 Each section contains parameter lines, each of which consist of a
 parameter name and value delimited by an equal sign.  Roughly, the
 syntax is:

   <file>            :==  { <section> } EOF

   <section>         :==  <section header> { <parameter line> }

   <section header>  :==  '[' NAME ']'

   <parameter line>  :==  NAME '=' VALUE '\n'

 Blank lines and comment lines are ignored.  Comment lines are lines
 beginning with either a semicolon (';') or a pound sign ('#').

 All whitespace in section names and parameter names is compressed
 to single spaces.  Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from
 both names and values.

 Only the first equals sign in a parameter line is significant.
 Parameter values may contain equals signs, square brackets and
 semicolons.  Internal whitespace is retained in parameter values,
 with the exception of the '\r' character, which is stripped for
 historic reasons.  Parameter names may not start with a left square
 bracket, an equal sign, a pound sign, or a semicolon, because these
 are used to identify other tokens.

  linux/include/linux/rbtree.h

  To use rbtrees you'll have to implement your own insert and search cores.
  This will avoid us to use callbacks and to drop drammatically performances.
  I know it's not the cleaner way,  but in C (not in C++) to get
  performances and genericity...

  Some example of insert and search follows here. The search is a plain
  normal search over an ordered tree. The insert instead must be implemented
  int two steps: as first thing the code must insert the element in
  order as a red leaf in the tree, then the support library function
  rb_insert_color() must be called. Such function will do the
  not trivial work to rebalance the rbtree if necessary.

 Test Windows SDDL handling.

 Copyright (c) 2023 Douglas Bagnall <dbagnall@samba.org>

 GPLv3+.

 This can be compiled on Windows under Cygwin, like this:


 gcc -o windows-sddl-tests  windows-sddl-tests.c \
	      C:/Windows/System32/advapi32.dll	-ladvapi32


 then run like this:

 ./windows-sddl-tests.exe


 That will show you a mix of success and failure.

 To run the tests in python/samba/tests/sddl.py, edit the method
 _test_write_test_strings(), removing the leading underscore so it starts
 with "test_". Then running

 make test TESTS='sddl\\b'

 will write some files into /tmp, containing lines like this:

 D:(A;;GA;;;RU) -> D:(A;;GA;;;RU)

 Copy these files to Windows. Then in Cygwin, run this:

 ./windows-sddl-tests.exe -i non_canonical.txt canonical.txt [...]

 and the part of each line before the " -> " will be fed into the SDDL
 parser, and back through the serialiser, which should result in the string
 after the " -> ". These are the tests that sddl.py does.

The 4 bit colours are available as global variables with names like
RED, DARK_RED, REV_RED (for red background), and REV_DARK_RED. If
switch_colour_off() is called, these names will all point to the
empty string. switch_colour_on() restores the default values.

The 256-colour codes are obtained using xterm_256_color(n), where n
is the number of the desired colour.

part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute

   Utility to extract pcap files from samba (log level 10) log files

   Copyright (C) Jelmer Vernooij 2003
   Thanks to Tim Potter for the genial idea

   Portions (from capconvert.c) (C) Andrew Tridgell 1997
   Portions (from text2pcap.c) (C) Ashok Narayanan 2001

   Example:
	Output NBSS(SMB) packets in hex and convert to pcap adding
	Eth/IP/TCP headers

	log2pcap -h < samba.log | text2pcap -T 139,139 - samba.pcap

	Output directly to pcap format without Eth headers or TCP
	sequence numbers

	log2pcap samba.log samba.pcap

    TODO:
	- Hex to text2pcap outputs are not properly parsed in Wireshark
	  the NBSS or SMB level.  This is a bug.
	- Writing directly to pcap format doesn't include sequence numbers
	  in the TCP packets
	- Check if a packet is a response or request and set IP to/from
	  addresses accordingly.  Currently all packets come from the same
	  dummy IP and go to the same dummy IP
	- Add a message when done parsing about the number of pacekts
	  processed
	- Parse NBSS packet header data from log file
	- Have correct IP and TCP checksums.

   Warning:
	Samba log level 10 outputs a max of 512 bytes from the packet data
	section.  Packets larger than this will be truncated.

source4/dsdb/tests/python/attr_from_server.py

-*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Tests a corner-case involving the fromServer attribute, which is slightly
unique: it's an Object(DS-DN) (like a one-way link), but it is also a
mandatory attribute (for nTDSConnection). The corner-case is that the
fromServer can potentially end up pointing to a non-existent object.
This can happen with other one-way links, but these other one-way links
are not mandatory attributes.

This file implements a RESTful HTTPS API to an online CA, as well as an
HTTP/Negotiate token issuer, as well as a way to get TGTs.

Users are authenticated with Negotiate and/or Bearer.

This is essentially a RESTful online CA sharing some code with the KDC's
kx509 online CA, and also a proxy for PKINIT and GSS-API (Negotiate).

See the manual page for HTTP API details.

TBD:
 - rewrite to not use libmicrohttpd but an alternative more appropriate to
   Heimdal's license (though libmicrohttpd will do)
 - there should be an end-point for fetching an issuer's chain

NOTES:
 - We use krb5_error_code values as much as possible.  Where we need to use
   MHD_NO because we got that from an mhd function and cannot respond with
   an HTTP response, we use (krb5_error_code)-1, and later map that to
   MHD_NO.

   (MHD_NO is an ENOMEM-cannot-even-make-a-static-503-response level event.)

@page page_des DES - Data Encryption Standard crypto interface

See the library functions here: @ref hcrypto_des

DES was created by IBM, modififed by NSA and then adopted by NBS
(now NIST) and published ad FIPS PUB 46 (updated by FIPS 46-1).

Since the 19th May 2005 DES was withdrawn by NIST and should no
longer be used. See @ref page_evp for replacement encryption
algorithms and interfaces.

Read more the iteresting history of DES on Wikipedia
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard .

@section des_keygen DES key generation

To generate a DES key safely you have to use the code-snippet
below. This is because the DES_random_key() can fail with an
abort() in case of and failure to start the random generator.

There is a replacement function DES_new_random_key(), however that
function does not exists in OpenSSL.

@code
DES_cblock key;
do {
    if (RAND_rand(&key, sizeof(key)) != 1)
         goto failure;
    DES_set_odd_parity(key);
} while (DES_is_weak_key(&key));
@endcode

@section des_impl DES implementation history

There was no complete BSD licensed, fast, GPL compatible
implementation of DES, so Love wrote the part that was missing,
fast key schedule setup and adapted the interface to the orignal
libdes.

The document that got me started for real was "Efficient
Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard" by Dag Arne Osvik.
I never got to the PC1 transformation was working, instead I used
table-lookup was used for all key schedule setup. The document was
very useful since it de-mystified other implementations for me.

The core DES function (SBOX + P transformation) is from Richard
Outerbridge public domain DES implementation. My sanity is saved
thanks to his work. Thank you Richard.

* @section intro Introduction
*
* Heimdal libhcrypto library is a implementation many crypto
* algorithms, among others: AES, SHA, DES, RSA, Camellia and many
* help function.
*
* hcrypto provies a OpenSSL compatible interface libcrypto interface
* and is licensed under a 3 clause BSD license (GPL compatible).
*
* The project web page: http://www.h5l.org/
*
* Sections of this manual:
*
* - @subpage page_evp, @ref hcrypto_evp
* - @subpage page_rand, @ref hcrypto_rand
* - @subpage page_dh, @ref hcrypto_dh
* - @subpage page_rsa, @ref hcrypto_rsa
* - @ref hcrypto_misc
*
* Older interfaces that you should not use:
*
* - @subpage page_des, @ref hcrypto_des
*
* @subsection control_functions Control functions
*
* Functions controlling general behavior, like adding algorithms, are
* documented in this module: @ref hcrypto_core .
*
* @subsection return_values Return values
*
* Return values are diffrent in this module to be compatible with
* OpenSSL interface. The diffrence is that on success 1 is returned
* instead of the customary 0.

* @subsection History
*
* Eric Young implemented DES in the library libdes, that grew into
* libcrypto in the ssleay package. ssleay went into recession and
* then got picked up by the OpenSSL (htp://www.openssl.org/)
* project.
*
* libhcrypto is an independent implementation with no code decended
* from ssleay/openssl. Both includes some common imported code, for
* example the AES implementation.

*
* SQLite processes all times and dates as julian day numbers.  The
* dates and times are stored as the number of days since noon
* in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the Gregorian
* calendar system.
*
* 1970-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2440587.5
* 2000-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2451544.5
*
* This implementation requires years to be expressed as a 4-digit number
* which means that only dates between 0000-01-01 and 9999-12-31 can
* be represented, even though julian day numbers allow a much wider
* range of dates.
*
* The Gregorian calendar system is used for all dates and times,
* even those that predate the Gregorian calendar.  Historians usually
* use the julian calendar for dates prior to 1582-10-15 and for some
* dates afterwards, depending on locale.  Beware of this difference.
*
* The conversion algorithms are implemented based on descriptions

* This file contains code to support the concept of "benign"
* malloc failures (when the xMalloc() or xRealloc() method of the
* sqlite3_mem_methods structure fails to allocate a block of memory
* and returns 0).
*
* Most malloc failures are non-benign. After they occur, SQLite
* abandons the current operation and returns an error code (usually
* SQLITE_NOMEM) to the user. However, sometimes a fault is not necessarily
* fatal. For example, if a malloc fails while resizing a hash table, this
* is completely recoverable simply by not carrying out the resize. The
* hash table will continue to function normally.  So a malloc failure
* during a hash table resize is a benign fault.

************************************************************************
* This file contains the C functions that implement a memory
* allocation subsystem for use by SQLite.
*
* This version of the memory allocation subsystem omits all
* use of malloc(). The application gives SQLite a block of memory
* before calling sqlite3_initialize() from which allocations
* are made and returned by the xMalloc() and xRealloc()
* implementations. Once sqlite3_initialize() has been called,
* the amount of memory available to SQLite is fixed and cannot
* be changed.
*
* This version of the memory allocation subsystem is included
* in the build only if SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMSYS5 is defined.
*
* This memory allocator uses the following algorithm:
*
*   1.  All memory allocation sizes are rounded up to a power of 2.
*
*   2.  If two adjacent free blocks are the halves of a larger block,
*       then the two blocks are coalesced into the single larger block.
*
*   3.  New memory is allocated from the first available free block.
*
* This algorithm is described in: J. M. Robson. "Bounds for Some Functions
* Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation". Journal of the Association for
* Computing Machinery, Volume 21, Number 8, July 1974, pages 491-499.
*
* Let n be the size of the largest allocation divided by the minimum
* allocation size (after rounding all sizes up to a power of 2.)  Let M
* be the maximum amount of memory ever outstanding at one time.  Let
* N be the total amount of memory available for allocation.  Robson
* proved that this memory allocator will never breakdown due to
* fragmentation as long as the following constraint holds:
*
*      N >=  M*(1 + log2(n)/2) - n + 1
*
* The sqlite3_status() logic tracks the maximum values of n and M so
* that an application can, at any time, verify this constraint.

* This file presents a simple cross-platform threading interface for
* use internally by SQLite.
*
* A "thread" can be created using sqlite3ThreadCreate().  This thread
* runs independently of its creator until it is joined using
* sqlite3ThreadJoin(), at which point it terminates.
*
* Threads do not have to be real.  It could be that the work of the
* "thread" is done by the main thread at either the sqlite3ThreadCreate()
* or sqlite3ThreadJoin() call.  This is, in fact, what happens in
* single threaded systems.  Nothing in SQLite requires multiple threads.
* This interface exists so that applications that want to take advantage
* of multiple cores can do so, while also allowing applications to stay
* single-threaded if desired.

*
* The layout of divisions is as follows:
*
*   *  General-purpose declarations and utility functions.
*   *  Unique file ID logic used by VxWorks.
*   *  Various locking primitive implementations (all except proxy locking):
*      + for Posix Advisory Locks
*      + for no-op locks
*      + for dot-file locks
*      + for flock() locking
*      + for named semaphore locks (VxWorks only)

*   *  sqlite3_file methods not associated with locking.
