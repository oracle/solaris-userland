TLS sequences are not understood by SPARC/Solaris linker. GCC generates the TLS
sequence in a different order than the TLS document suggests. GNU linker can
handle this, however we are using Solaris linker, which doesn't understand this
sequence, and hence generated TLS code is incorrect.

This was reported to upstream, fixed there, and should
be available in a later release of GCC 9.
