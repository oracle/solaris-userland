*****************************************************************************
The text that follows is the GNU General Public License, Version 2 (GPL V2)
and governs your use, modification and/or distribution of SNORT.

Section 9 of the GPL V2 acknowledges that the Free Software Foundation may
publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL V2 from time to time.  Section 9
further states that a licensee of a program subject to the GPL V2 could be
free to use any such revised and/or new versions under two different scenarios:

1. "Failure to Specify." Section 9 of the GPL V2 allows a licensee of a
program governed by an unspecified version of the General Public License to
choose any version of the General Public License ever published by the Free
Software Foundation to govern his or her use of such program.

This provision is not applicable to your use of SNORT because we have
expressly stated in a number of instances that any third party's use,
modification or distribution of SNORT is governed by GPL V2.

2. "Any Later Version." At the end of the terms and condition of the GPL V2 is
a section called "How to Apply these Terms to Your New Program," which
provides guidance to a developer on how to apply the GPL V2 to a third party's
use, modification and/or distribution of his/her program. Among other things,
this guidance suggests that the developer attach certain notices to the
program. Of particular importance is the following notice:

"This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version."

Thus if a developer follows strictly the guidance provided by the Free
Software Foundation, Section 9 of the GPL V2 provides the licensee the option
to either use, modify or distribute the program under GPL V2 or under any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

SNORT is an open source project that is governed exclusively by the GPL V2
and any third party desiring to use, modify or distribute SNORT must do so by
strictly following the terms and conditions of GPL V2. Anyone using, modifying
or distributing SNORT does not have the option to chose to use, modify or
distribute SNORT under any revised or new version of the GPL, including
without limitation, the GNU General Public License Version 3.

For ease of reference, the comparable notice that is used with SNORT
(contained in the 'README' file) is as follows:

"This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 as published by the Free
Software Foundation. You may not use, modify or distribute this program under
any other version of the GNU General Public License."

If you have any questions about this statement, please feel free to email

	       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.	For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.	You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.	EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301,
    USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

**
**  DESCRIPTION
**	 The following subroutines are concerned with getting
**	 basic stats on packet bytes and times that an app
**	 takes in processing packets.  The times measured are
**	 kernel and user time for the process.	 Real-time
**	 (wall clock) is also measured to show when processing
**	 has reached capacity and to measure the true processing
**	 that the app is currently doing.
**
**  NOTES
**	 4.8.02  : Initial Code (DJR,MAN)
**	 4.22.02 : Added Comments (DJR)
**	 7.10.02 : Added sfprocpidstats code for SMP linux (DJR)
**	 8.8.02  : Added stream4 instrumentation (cmg)
**	 9.1.04  : Removed NO_PKTS, ACCUMULATE/RESET #defines, now we use SFBASE->iReset
**		   and the permonitor command has 'reset' and 'accrue' commands instead.(MAN)
**	 10.4.06 : Added UDP Session Stats (SAS)
**	 4.3.07  : Added stats for TCP sessions (SAS)

 *	[prog, vers].  prot and port are ignored.
 *
 * PMAPPROC_GETPORT(struct pmap) returns (unsigned long).
 *	0 is failure.  Otherwise returns the port number where the pair
 *	[prog, vers] is registered.  It may lie!
 *
 * PMAPPROC_DUMP() RETURNS (struct pmaplist *)
 *
 * PMAPPROC_CALLIT(unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int, string<>)

**	+++ Version 1.0 notes - Marc Norton:
**	+++
**
**	Original implementation based on the 4 algorithms in the paper by
**	Aho & Corasick, some implementation ideas from 'Practical Algorithms
**	in C', and some of my own.
**
**	1) Finds all occurrences of all patterns within a text.
**
**	+++
**	+++ Version 2.0 Notes - Marc Norton/Dan Roelker:
**	+++
**
**	New implementation modifies the state table storage and access model to
**	use compacted sparse vector storage. Dan Roelker and I hammered this
**	strategy out amongst many others in order to reduce memory usage and
**	improve caching performance.  The memory usage is greatly reduced, we
**	only use 1/4 of what we use to. The caching performance is better in
**	pure benchmarking tests, but does not show overall improvement in Snort.
**	Unfortunately, once a pattern match test has been performed Snort moves
**	on to doing many other things before we get back to a patteren match test,
**	so the cache is voided.
**
**	This versions has better caching performance characteristics, reduced
**	memory, more state table storage options, and requires no a priori case
**	conversions.  It does maintain the same public interface. (Snort only
**	used banded storage).
**
**	  1) Supports NFA and DFA state machines, and basic keyword state machines
**	  2) Initial transition table uses Linked Lists
**	  3) Improved state table memory options. NFA and DFA state transition
**	     tables are converted to one of 4 formats during compilation.
**	     a) Full matrix
**	     b) Sparse matrix
**	     c) Banded matrix (Default-this is the only one used in snort)
**	     d) Sparse-Banded matrix
**	  4) Added support for acstate_t in .h file so we can compile states as
**	     16, or 32 bit state values for another reduction in memory
**	     consumption, smaller states allows more of the state table to be
**	     cached, and improves performance on x86-P4.  Your mileage may vary,
**	     especially on risc systems.
**	  5) Added a bool to each state transition list to indicate if there is
**	     a matching pattern in the state. This prevents us from accessing
**	     another data array and can improve caching/performance.
**	  6) The search functions are very sensitive, don't change them without
**	     extensive testing, or you'll just spoil the caching and prefetching
**	     opportunities.
**
**	Extras for fellow pattern matchers:
**	 The table below explains the storage format used at each step.
**	 You can use an NFA or DFA to match with, the NFA is slower but tiny -
**	 set the structure directly.
**	 You can use any of the 4 storage modes above -full, sparse, banded,
**	 sparse-bands, set the structure directly.
**	 For applications where you have lots of data and a pattern set to
**	 search, this version was up to 3x faster than the previous verion, due
**	 to caching performance. This cannot be fully realized in Snort yet,
**	 but other applications may have better caching opportunities.
**	 Snort only needs to use the banded or full storage.
**
**  Transition table format at each processing stage.
**  -------------------------------------------------
**  Patterns -> Keyword State Table (List)
**  Keyword State Table -> NFA (List)
**  NFA -> DFA (List)
**  DFA (List)-> Sparse Rows  O(m-avg # transitions per state)
**	     -> Banded Rows  O(1)
**		 -> Sparse-Banded Rows O(nb-# bands)
**	     -> Full Matrix  O(1)
**
** Notes:
**
** 8/28/06
** man - Sparse and SparseBands - fixed off by one in calculating matching index
**	    SparseBands changed ps increment to 2+n to increment between bands.
**
** 01/2008
**  man - added 2 phase pattern matcher using a pattern match queue.
**
**  Matching states are queued, duplicate matches are dropped,
**  and after the complete buffer scan the queued matches are
**  processed.  This improves cacheing performance, and reduces
**  duplicate rule processing.  The queue is limited in size and
**  is flushed if it becomes full during the scan.  This allows
**  simple insertions. Tracking queue ops is optional, as this can
**  impose a modest performance hit of a few percent.

** bnfa_search.c
**
** Basic multi-pattern search engine using Aho-Corasick NFA construction.
**
** Version 3.0  (based on acsmx.c and acsmx2.c)
**
** author: marc norton
** date:   started 12/21/05
**
** Copyright (C) 2014-2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.
** Copyright (C) 2005-2013 Sourcefire, Inc.
**
** General Design
**  Aho-Corasick based NFA state machine.
**  Compacted sparse storage mode for better performance.
**  Up to 16 Million states + transitions (combined) in compacted sparse mode.
**
**  ** Compacted sparse array storage **
**
**  The primary data is held in one array.
**  The patterns themselves are stored separately.
**  The matching lists of patterns for each state are stored separately as well.
**  The compacted sparse format improves caching/performance.
**
**	word 1 : state	( only low 24 bits are used )
**	word 2 : control word = cb << 24 | fs
**	cb: control byte
**	    cb = mb | fb | nt
**	mb : 8th bit - if set state has matching patterns bit
**	fb : 7th bit - if set full storage array bit (256 entries used),
		       else sparse
**	nt : 0-63= number of transitions (more than 63 requires full storage)
**	fs: 24 bits for failure state transition index.
**	word 3+ : transition word =  input<<24 |  next-state-index
**	input : 8 bit character, input to state machine from search text
**	next-state-index: 24 bits for index of next state
**	  (if we reallly need 16M states, we can add a state->index lookup array)
**	  ...repeat for each state ...
**
**	* if a state is empty it has words 1 and 2, but no transition words.
**
**	Construction:
**
**	Patterns are added to a list based trie.
**	The list based trie is compiled into a list based NFA with failure states.
**	The list based NFA is converted to full or sparse format NFA.
**	The Zero'th state sparse transitions may be stored in full format for
**	   performance.
**	Sparse transition arrays are searched using linear and binary search
**	   strategies depending on the number of entries to search through in
**	   each state.
**	The state machine in sparse mode is compacted into a single vector for
**	   better performance.
**
** Notes:
**
** The NFA can require twice the state transitions that a DFA uses. However,
** the construction of a DFA generates many additional transitions in each
** state which consumes significant additional memory. This particular
** implementation is best suited to environments where the very large memory
** requirements of a full state table implementation is not possible and/or
** the speed trade off is warranted to maintain a small memory footprint.
**
** Each state of an NFA usually has very few transitions but can have up to
** 256.  It is important to not degenerate into a linear search so we utilize
** a binary search if there are more than 5 elements in the state to test for
** a match.	This allows us to use a simple sparse memory design with an
** acceptable worst case search scenario.  The binary search over 256 elements
** is limtied to a max of 8 tests.  The zero'th state may use a full 256 state
** array, so a quick index lookup provides the next state transition.  The
** zero'th state is generally visited much more than other states.
**
** Compiling : gcc, Intel C/C++, Microsoft C/C++, each optimize differently.
** My studies have shown Intel C/C++ 9,8,7 to be the fastest, Microsoft 8,7,6
** is next fastest, and gcc 4.x,3.x,2.x is the slowest of the three.  My
** testing has been mainly on x86.  In general gcc does a poor job with
** optimizing this state machine for performance, compared to other less cache
** and prefetch sensitive algorithms.  I've documented this behavior in a
** paper 'Optimizing Pattern Matching for IDS' (www.sourcefire.com,
** www.idsresearch.org).
**
** The code is sensitive to cache optimization and prefetching, as well as
** instruction pipelining.  Aren't we all.  To this end, the number of
** patterns, length of search text, and cpu cache L1,L2,L3 all affect
** performance. The relative performance of the sparse and full format NFA and
** DFA varies as you vary the pattern charactersitics,and search text length,
** but strong performance trends are present and stable.

**  BNFA API SUMMARY
**
**  bnfa=bnfaNew();		   create a state machine
**  bnfaAddPattern(bnfa,..);    add a pattern to the state machine
**  bnfaCompile (bnfa,..)	   compile the state machine
**  bnfaPrintInfo(bnfa);	   print memory usage and state info
**  bnfaPrint(bnfa); 	   print the state machine in total
**  state=bnfaSearch(bnfa, ...,state);  search a data buffer for a pattern match
**  bnfaFree (bnfa); 	   free the bnfa

**
** 12/4/06 - man - modified summary
** 6/26/07 - man - Added last_match tracking, and accounted for nocase/case by
**		      preseting the last match state, and reverting if we fail the
**		      case memcmp test for any rule in the states matching rule
**		      list.  The states in the defaul matcher represent either
**		      case or nocase states, so they are dual mode, that makes
**		      this a bit tricky.  When we sue the pure exact match, or
**		      pure don't care matching routines, we just track the last
**		      state, and never need to revert.	This only tracks the
**		      single repeated states and repeated data.
** 01/2008 - man - added 2 phase pattern matcher using a pattern match queue.
**		      Text is scanned and matching states are queued, duplicate
**		      matches are dropped, and after the complete buffer scan the
**		      queued matches are processed.  This improves cacheing
**		      performance, and reduces duplicate rule processing.  The
**		      queue is limited in size and is flushed if it becomes full
**		      during the scan.	This allows simple insertions.	Tracking
**		      queue ops is optional, as this can impose a modest
**		      performance hit of a few percent.

 * Log events, retrieve events, and select events that HttpInspect
 * generates.
 *
 * Logging Events:
 *	Since the object behind this is no memset()s, we have to rely on the
 *	stack interface to make sure we don't log the same event twice.  So
 *	if there are events in the stack we cycle through to make sure that
 *	there are none available before we add a new event and increment the
 *	stack count.  Then to reset the event queue, we just need to set the
 *	stack count back to zero.

**	Reference - Efficient String matching: An Aid to Bibliographic Search
**		    Alfred V Aho and Margaret J Corasick
**		    Bell Labratories
**		    Copyright(C) 1975 Association for Computing Machinery,Inc
**
**	Implemented from the 4 algorithms in the paper by Aho & Corasick
**	and some implementation ideas from 'Practical Algorithms in C'
**
**	Notes:
**	  1) This version uses about 1024 bytes per pattern character - heavy  on the memory.
**	  2) This algorithm finds all occurrences of all patterns within a
**	     body of text.
**	  3) Support is included to handle upper and lower case matching.
**	  4) Some comopilers optimize the search routine well, others don't, this makes all the difference.
**	  5) Aho inspects all bytes of the search text, but only once so it's very efficient,
**	     if the patterns are all large than the Modified Wu-Manbar method is often faster.
**	  6) I don't subscribe to any one method is best for all searching needs,
**	     the data decides which method is best,
**	     and we don't know until after the search method has been tested on the specific data sets.
**
**
**  May 2002  : Marc Norton 1st Version
**  June 2002 : Modified interface for SNORT, added case support
**  Aug 2002  : Cleaned up comments, and removed dead code.
**  Nov 2,2002: Fixed queue_init() , added count=0

 * of FTPTelnet should be separate from the preprocessor hooks.

 * Description:
 *
 * This file wraps the FTPTelnet functionality for Snort
 * and starts the Normalization & Protocol checks.
 *
 * The file takes a Packet structure from the Snort IDS to start the
 * FTP/Telnet Normalization & Protocol checks.  It also uses the Stream
 * Interface Module which is also Snort-centric.  Mainly, just a wrapper
 * to FTP/Telnet functionality, but a key part to starting the basic flow.
 *
 * The main bulk of this file is taken up with user configuration and
 * parsing.	The reason this is so large is because FTPTelnet takes
 * very detailed configuration parameters for each specified FTP client,
 * to provide detailed control over an internal network and robust control
 * of the external network.
 *
 * The main functions of note are:
 *	- FTPTelnetSnortConf()	  the configuration portion
 *	- SnortFTPTelnet()	  the actual normalization & inspection
 *	- LogEvents()		  where we log the FTPTelnet events

 * Session Inspection Module retrieves the user-data from the Stream
 * Module.  For stateless inspection, the Session Inspection Module uses
 * the same structure for use by each packet.
 *
 * The main responsibility of this module is to supply the appropriate
 * data structures and configurations for the rest of the FTPTelnet
 * process.	The module also determines what type of data is being
 * inspected, whether it is client, server, or neither.
