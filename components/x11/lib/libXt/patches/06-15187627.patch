Oracle Bug 15187627 - SUNBT4962001 There are some memory leak in motif

Root Cause:
This bug exists because function "GetResources" will return a copy of resource
to the function caller in case the caller want to check on the resource and
the caller has the responsibility to free the returned copy, however some
functions, such as "XtCreate", "XtGetSubresources", "_XtGetResources",
"XtGetSubresources", invoked "GetResources" and "XtGetApplicationResources"
without freeing the returned resource copy.

[This is only one portion of the original fix, which also modified
 Resources.c - need to determine if this is still correct and then
 either submit upstream or discard.]

Solution:
Free the returned resource copy in caller functions.
