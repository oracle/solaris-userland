Linux version of keymapping setup. The kernel (since 0.99.14) has support
for fully remapping the keyboard, but there are some differences between
the Linux map and the SVR4 map (esp. in the extended keycodes). We also
remove the restriction on what keycodes can be remapped.

Portions of this file were derived from the following files:

xfree86/common/xf86KbdLnx.c

Linux version of keymapping setup. The kernel (since 0.99.14) has support
for fully remapping the keyboard, but there are some differences between
the Linux map and the SVR4 map (esp. in the extended keycodes). We also
remove the restriction on what keycodes can be remapped.
