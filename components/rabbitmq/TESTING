############################## RabbitMQ TEST ##############################

# In order to verify that the RabbitMQ server can accept and
# forward messages, we will need the following (virtual) machines:
# 1) RabbitMQ server (require a public IP address)
# 2) Client 1
# 3) Client 2

# Execute on: RabbitMQ server, Client 1, Client 2
# Install the same version of Erlang package (runtime/erlang).
sudo pkg install runtime/erlang

# Execute on: RabbitMQ server
# Compile the rabbitmq component and execute the automated test.
# Note that we disable rabbitmq service otherwise the test may fail.
sudo svcadm disable -s rabbitmq
cd ${RABBITMQ_WORKSPACE}/components/rabbitmq
gmake test

# Execute on: RabbitMQ server
# Create a special user for testing purposes since
# the default user "guest" can be used only for localhost.
# The created user is assigned all the conf, write, and read permissions.
sudo svcadm enable -s rabbitmq
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user "${RABBIT_USER}" "${RABBIT_PASSWD}"
sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags "${RABBIT_USER}" administrator
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / "${RABBIT_USER}" ".*" ".*" ".*"

# Execute on: RabbitMQ server
# Start the RabbitMQ management website.
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stomp

# Execute on: Machine with a web browser
# Check that the created user can log in and monitor RabbitMQ instance.
# RABBITMQ_HOST is a host name or IP address of RabbitMQ server.
firefox http://${RABBITMQ_HOST}:15672

# Execute on: RabbitMQ server
# Copy the archive, which was created by the 'gmake test' command,
# with Erlang clients to a directory accessible from the client machines.
cp build/${MACH64}/test-rabbit/pingpong_test.tar.bz "${SHARED_FOLDER}"

# Execute on: Client 1, Client 2
# To prepare client applications, we extract the archive
# that already contains all the bytecode (+source code) required.
cp "${SHARED_FOLDER}/pingpong_test.tar.bz" "${CLIENT_APP_DIR}/"
cd "${CLIENT_APP_DIR}"
gtar -xf pingpong_test.tar.bz
cd pingpong_test

# Testing scenario:
# 1) Client 1 sends "ping" message to RabbitMQ server ('ping_queue')
# 2) Client 2 receives "ping" message from RabbitMQ server ('ping_queue')
# 3) Client 2 sends "pong" message to RabbitMQ server ('pong_queue')
# 4) Client 1 receives "pong" message" from RabbitMQ server ('pong_queue')

# Execute on: Client 1
# Start the "ping" application and go to the next step.
erl -noshell -run ping main "${RABBITMQ_HOST}" "${RABBIT_USER}" "${RABBIT_PASSWD}" -s init stop

# Execute on: Client 2
# Start the "pong" application.
erl -noshell -run pong main "${RABBITMQ_HOST}" "${RABBIT_USER}" "${RABBIT_PASSWD}" -s init stop

# Expected output on Client 1:
# > client 1: Message '<<"ping">>' sent!
# > client 1: Received '<<"pong">>' message!
# Expected output on Client 2:
# > client 2: Received '<<"ping">>' message!
# > client 2: Message '<<"pong">>' sent!

############################## TEST COMPONENTS USING RABBITMQ ##############################

# Currently, the following components require RabbitMQ server:
# 1) ruby/mcollective (https://github.com/puppetlabs/marionette-collective)
#    -> Please test mcollective component according to its TESTING file.
# 2) python/amqp (https://github.com/celery/py-amqp/)
#    -> Run the automated tests and check the results.
# 3) python/librabbitmq (https://github.com/celery/librabbitmq)
#    -> Run the automated tests and check the results.
# 4) puppet/puppetlabs-rabbitmq (https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-rabbitmq)
#    -> cd /usr/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/rabbitmq/examples
#    -> Use 'puppet apply' command to test the application of example configurations.
# 5) python/pyrabbit (https://github.com/bkjones/pyrabbit)
#    -> Visit the github page, clone the repository, and checkout the right version.
#    -> Go to the 'tests' directory and install python dependencies (pip install $(DEPS) --user).
#    -> Execute test_pyrabbit.py for each python version and check test_out.log file.
# 6) ruby/stomp (https://github.com/stompgem/stomp)
#    -> STOMP plugin is used in Puppet MCollective, so it was indirectly verified in 1).
