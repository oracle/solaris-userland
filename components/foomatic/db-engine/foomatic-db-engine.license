 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

component.


Intro
-----

This is the stable version of Foomatic. This version is also the base
of our database web interface on

http://www.openprinting.org/


New features for Foomatic 4.0.x
-------------------------------

Added in 4.0.0:

 - Support for the PDF-based printing workflow. foomatic-rip now
   understands both PostScript and PDF as input. PPDs are generated
   with two "*cupsFilter" lines now, so that CUPS knows that also PDF
   can get fed in. By the cost factors PDF is made the preferred input
   format.

 - foomatic-rip is rewritten in C, so that libraries can be used
   without needing Perl bindings.

 - Support for CUPS custom options. If a printer/driver combo has
   numerical, string, or password options, appropriate keywords are
   added to the PPD so that these options are also recognized as CUPS
   custom options (see
   http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.4/spec-ppd.html for the
   CUPS PPD extension for custom options).

 - PJL/JCL options in PPD files are now generated in the standard way
   as defined by the PPD specs. Foomatic keywords are only used if
   really necessary.

 - Generated PPDs have now an additional "*cupsFilter:" line to tell
   CUPS that foomatic-rip understands PDF input (output of the
   "pdftopdf" CUPS filter).

 - Driver XML files can now have a new "<prototype_pdf>" tag in the
   "<execution>" section, to supply a different command line prototype
   for PDF input. If left out, the same command line prototype is used
   for both PDF and PostScript input.

 - Margins in generated PPDs now default to safer values and not to
   zero if no margins are specified in the XML files.

 - CUPS page accounting can be suppressed on a per-driver basis now,
   via the tag "<nopageaccounting>" and the PPD keyword
   "*FoomaticRIPNoPageAccounting: True".

 - Added new "foomatic-ppd-to-xml" utility to generate Foomatic XML
   files corresponding to a given PPD file.

 - Printer/driver relations now can be defined by the "<printers>"
   section in the driver XML file or by the "<drivers>" section in the
   printer XML file. Before, only the former was possible.

 - Added find_printer() method, to search for printers in the
   database. This method is especially used by the web query API for
   automatic driver/PPD downloads from the OpenPrinting web site. It
   can also be used in a local installation with the new
   "foomatic-searchprinter" utility.

 - Added support for more detailed driver information, like license,
   whether it is free, whether it comes from the printer's
   manufacturer, support contacts, short description, by-task
   ratings. This gives more information to decide on downloading and
   installing a driver for both driver auto download and browsing the
   OpenPrinting web site. The information can also be used by printer
   setup tools using a locally installed Foomatic database. The
   information is available in the driver XML files (there one enters
   it), the PPD files, and also in the device ID strings, defined in
   the PPDs (so that the information goes into the output of "lpinfo
   -l -m" of CUPS).


New features for Foomatic 3.0.x
-------------------------------

Added after 3.0.2:

 - Support for on-the-fly PPD generation by CUPS 1.2. Now all Foomatic
   PPDs appear in the model lists of the CUPS web interface without
   needing to pre-compile the PPDs. The PPDs get actually generated if
   one selects them for the new print queue to be set up.

Added in 3.0.2:

 - Some fixes to make foomatic-rip more robust against weird input via
   the command line or environment variables are done. This solves the
   problem of an attacker being able to run arbitrary commands as "lp"
   (or however the spooler's special user is named) on the print
   server (Security Advisory CAN-2004-0801).

 - Workaround for PostScript generation bug in all OpenOffice.org
   1.1.x versions.

 - Let the PPD generator use the manufacturer as defined in the
   Foomatic database and not the one from the IEEE-1284 auto-detection
   ID string for the "*Manufacturer: ..." tag of the PPD files, as in
   the IDs the manufacturer names often do not comply with the Adobe
   specs (as "Hewlett-Packard", "HP" has to be used).

Added in 3.0.1:

 - CUPS raster drivers can now be used with any spooler. This makes a
   lot of newer commercial or manufacturer-supplied printer drivers
   available for non-CUPS environments. To use a CUPS raster driver
   with a spooler other than CUPS, you need to install Ghostscript
   (preferrably ESP Ghostscript) with CUPS raster support, the
   appropriate CUPS raster driver. You do not need to install the
   complete CUPS package, the CUPS libraries are enough (libcups and
   libcupsimage, usually in the "libcups" package of your
   distribution) and to compile CUPS raster drivers you need also the
   header files of the CUPS library (libcups-devel, cupsys-dev, or
   similar package of your distro). Then you can set up a print queue
   with the PPD file of the CUPS driver the same way as if you had a
   native PostScript printer.

 - If a printer/driver combo has Foomatic-defined JCL options and the
   driver already generates a JCL header, the JCL options are merged
   into the header produced by the driver.

 - Workaround for newly introduced PostScript generation bug of
   OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 (OOo puts settings for whole document into
   "%%PageSetup" section of first page).

 - Added "use strict;" to the most important Perl scripts, clean-up of
   the scripts (Thanks to Patrick Powell from LPRng)

 - Improved LPRng support (Thanks to Patrick Powell from LPRng)

 - Printer listing options and auto-selection of recommended driver
   for the PPD generator foomatic-ppdfile (Thanks to Patrick Powell
   from LPRng).

 - Support for string options and additional operation modes for
   foomatic-addpjloptions (Thanks to Patrick Powell from LPRng).

 - Additional checks in the configure scripts (Thanks to Patrick
   Powell from LPRng).

 - Composite options can be nested now (normal and forced composite
   options can be mixed).

 - Several modifications to make the PPD files compatible with the
   PostScript drivers for Windows: 100 instead of 999 choices for the
   "Copies" options, no "," and "+" in the "*NickName" and
   "*ShortNickName" entries, optional cutting of the long names of the
   options and choices (translation strings in the PPDs) to 39
   characters for compatibility with the Microsoft PostScript driver
   and the original PostScript driver for Windows of CUPS. All this is
   not required by the Adobe specification for PPD files.

 - Compatibility fixes for IRIX and the *BSD operating systems.

 - Script to update the "gutenprint" driver entry in the database
   using the src/foomatic/foomatic-printermap file of the source
   tarball of Gutenprint 5.0.x.

 - perltoxml() Perl function in DB.pm to generate XML database entries
   from PPD files (thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat).

 - Let foomatic-ppdfile (which can be also called under the name
   "foomatic-datafile", for compatibility with frontends) accept and
   ignore the "-t" option for backwards compatibility. Now the KDE
   Printing Manager works correctly again.

 - Fixed PPD file generation so that the files pass the "cupstestppd"
   of CUPS 1.1.20.

Added in 3.0.0:

 - For all supported spoolers (CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ,
   CPS, no spooler) the same PostScript-to-printer's-native-language
   filter (RIP, Raster Image Processor), foomatic-rip is
   used. foomatic-rip detects automatically from which spooler it is
   called.

 - foomatic-rip gets the info about the printer's capabilities and the
   driver options and default settings always from PPD files,
   independent which spooler is used. It is possible to use
   Foomatic-generated PPD files (usually for non-PostScript printers)
   or manufacturer- supplied PPD files of PostScript printers. So

    o PPD files of PostScript printers can be used with every spooler,
      not only with CUPS and PPR and on all spoolers all options will
      be available. So PostScript printers work always "Perfectly".

    o With the PPD file one has one configuration file for every place
      where information about the printer and its options is needed:
      The print queue itself, PPD-aware applications (as Star Office,
      OpenOffice.org, GIMP, ...), and clients (Windows, Mac, Unix with
      arbitrary spooler). The PPD format is a standard format used by
      every modern operating system.

 - PPD building and PostScript processing is done according to the
   Adobe specifications DSC (Document Structuring Conventions) and PPD
   (PostScript Printer Description) as published on

   http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/ps/index_specs.html

 - foomatic-rip inserts all default settings from the PPD file (so you
   can edit the "*Default..." lines in the PPD files to set the
   defaults), reads option settings from the user's command line, and
   from the PostScript data stream. Settings in the PostScript data
   stream have the highest priority to assure that what one sets in an
   application is used. Depending on the option type the settings are
   applied to the renderer's (usually Ghostscript's) command line, to
   the JCL header, or stuffed in at the right place of the PostScript
   data stream.

 - Support for option settings only acting on a certain page selection
   (example: First page on letterhead paper from tray 1, rest on plain
   paper from tray 2). Settings must be put into the
   "%%BeginPageSetup"/ "%%EndPageSetup" sections (or at least right
   after the "%%Page:" comments) of the appropriate pages in the
   PostScript input file. They can also be specified on the command
   line by specifying a page range before the option name (ex: "lpr -o
   1,5-8:ColorMode=CMYK file.ps"). If necessary, the renderer (usually
   Ghostscript) is stopped and restarted in the middle of the job,
   when certain pages need a different command line for the
   renderer. The bug of Star Office/OpenOffice.org inserting the
   "%%BeginSetup...%%EndSetup" section after the first "%%Page:"
   comment is taken care of.

 - foomatic-rip does neither use temporary files on the disk, nor does
   it need to load huge documents completely into memory. All is done
   in data streams where not more data than necessary is buffered. To
   make this possible foomatic-rip forks into up to six sub-processes.

 - The installation is very easy, one needs only foomatic-rip
   (absolutely monolithic, no Perl modules needed), a PPD file, and
   optionally foomatic-gswrapper. No different files for different
   spoolers.

 - Custom page size support with all spoolers when the PPD file has
   Adobe-compliant definitions for usage of custom page sizes.

 - The spooler-less printing mode of foomatic-rip can be used for
   testing and debugging PPD files in arbitrary directories, one
   simply specifies them with the new "--ppd" option.

 - With PDQ one can print arbitrary file types now, and even set up
   raw printers. The PDQ driver files are generated by foomatic-rip,
   so the user does not need to download more files than with other
   spoolers.

 - Under PPR 1.50 and newer foomatic-rip runs as a PPR RIP, under
   older versions, as before, as a PPR interface.

 - foomatic-configure sets up printer queues based on Foomatic
   database entries, arbitrary third-party PPDs (as shipped with
   PostScript printers), or raw queues.

 - foomatic-configure is much faster when copying or modifying print
   queues now, as it does not rebuild the PPD from the Foomatic
   database all the time (as long as one does not force a rebuild with
   "-f").

 - foomatic-addpjloptions works also in regular installations now, not
   only in "inplace" installations.

 - foomatic-compiledb generates only PPD and XML files now.

 - foomatic-datafile is renamed to foomatic-ppdfile, a compatibility
   link named foomatic-datafile is set. foomatic-ppdfile generates
   only PPDs, the options "-t" and "-f" are ignored.

 - foomatic-configure, foomatic-printjob, and all the other scripts
   have the same command lines as in Foomatic 2.0. Exceptions: In
   foomatic-configure "--oldppd" was dropped, "--ppd" (for setting up
   a queue with a third-party PPD file) added, and the meaning of "-f"
   (force rebuild of PPD) changed.

 - Option groups: Options can be put into groups and subgroups in the
   PPD files, so that GUIs can present them in a structured way (in
   tabs or in a tree structure). It is nearly completely functional,
   the only thing missing is translation support ("long names" for the
   groups, as "Adjustments and Corrections" for "Adjustment", or
   translations to other languages). Now the PPD generator makes
   trivial translations ("ThisIsAGroup" -> "This Is A Group")
   automatically.

 - Composite options: This is a new option type to make it easier for
   users to choose the best settings for a certain printing task,
   especially if the driver has very many options. The idea is to have
   an enumerated choice option which does not directly modify
   something in the driver's command line but sets several of the
   other options.

   We will have a "Printout Mode" option for all printers with the
   following choices:

      Draft
      Normal
      High Quality
      Very High Quality
      Photo

   For an Epson Stylus Color 680 with Gutenprint it sets the options
   resolution, dithering, and image type as follows:

      Choice           Resolution     Dither            ImageType
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Draft            180x180 dpi    Very Fast         LineArt
      Normal           360x360 dpi    Adaptive Hybrid   Photographs
      High Quality     720x720 dpi    Adaptive Hybrid   Photographs
      Very High Qual.  1440x720 dpi   Adaptive Hybrid   Photographs
      Photo            2880x720 dpi   Even Tone         Photographs

   The mentioned settings set all the color mode to "Color", there are
   also choices with a ".Gray" modifier (ex: "Normal.Gray" which set
   the color mode to "Grayscale", but the other mentioned options as
   the standard variants ("Normal").

   The member options of the composite option all get one choice
   called "FromPrintoutMode"/"Controlled by 'Printout Mode'" added,
   which gets their default setting. If this choice is selected, the
   option is set by the composite option according to the table. If
   the user wants to modify one of the individual member options, he
   simply chooses a value other than "FromPrintoutMode" for this
   particular option. In addition the member options will be put into
   a group (named "Printout Mode"). and the composite option goes into
   the same group as "PageSize", "InputSlot", ... So the user sees the
   composite option on the "Front page" of the GUI and can quickly set
   up print jobs without getting confused. The user with more special
   demands goes to the tab with the member options and makes detailed
   choices.

 - Forced composite options: These are special composite options where
   the user cannot set the individual member options, but only the
   composite option (the user is forced to use the composite
   option). This allows options acting at two or more places, for
   example a "PageSize" option for a driver which is a filter
   translating Ghostscript bitmap output to the printer's
   language. One lets one member option be an option inserting
   PostScript code for the page size into the PostScript input data
   stream for Ghostscript, and another member option insert the
   correct bitmap size into the filter's command line. The user sees
   only the composite option and sets the paper size with it as usual.

 - String and password options: These options allow the user to supply
   nearly arbitrary strings (a length limit and restrictions be a list
   of allowed characters or a Perl regular expression can be set) to
   the printer driver, for example names of color calibration files,
   fax numbers, passwords for confidential jobs, ... Frequently needed
   strings can be added as enumerated choices, so a frontend can show
   the option as a combo-box. The enumerated choices are also used for
   frontends which only support options as defined by the PPD spec.

 - New handling of numerical options in the PPD files:
   "*Default<option>: ..." now always contains one of the enumerated
   choices to be Adobe-compliant, the exact default value for
   Foomatic-aware applications is stored with the new
   "*FoomaticRIPDefault<option>: ..." keywords now.

 - URIs (Unified Resource Identifiers, the descriptions for the
   printer connection type used with the "-c" option of
   foomatic-configure) are exactly the same as under CUPS now. The
   only difference was that before for local printers always URIs
   beginning with "file:" were used, now "parallel:", "usb:", or
   "serial:" is used. The old form with "file:" is still accepted for
   compatibility.

 - For USB printers CUPS 1.1.17 and newer supports URIs which refer to
   manufacturer, model, and serial number and not to the device file
   (/dev/usb/lp*) any more. This way the queues still work when the
   printers are plugged in or turned on in another order in a later
   session (the printers can get different device files
   then). Foomatic now automatically converts the conventional USB
   URIs to the new ones when an appropriate versions of CUPS is used.
   When copying a queue to another spooler the URI is converted back
   in the copied queue.

 - Support for the MTink daemon from the MTink package
   (http://xwtools.automatix.de/). MTink allows monitoring the ink
   levels of Epson inkjets also while printing.

 - Non-printable margins: Both printer and driver XML database entries
   should get a new section for unprintable margins, so that the
   "*ImageableArea" entries in the PPD files can be correctly set.
   Entries should be possible for printers (printer XML file), for
   drivers (main part of driver XML file), for printer/driver combos
   (in printer list of driver XML file), and they can contain general
   margins (valid for all paper sizes) and paper-size-specific
   margins.  If for one "*ImageableArea" entry in a PPD file more than
   one of the above mentioned possible margin entries applies, the
   "worst case" (individually determined for each page border) is
   inserted. If the unprintable margins of a printer depend on options
   settings, the "worst case" is chosen, too.

 - Facility to make a package consisting of all possible Foomatic PPD
   files, foomatic-rip, and foomatic-configure, see
   README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds for how to proceed.

 - Support for inserting arbitrary constant entries (as a default
   resolution if there is no "Resolution" option) into the PPD
   file. The entries can be printer-specific, driver-specific, or
   printer/driver-combo-specific.

 - Extended structure for auto-detection info in printer XML files:
   General section for entries valid for both USB and parallel port
   connection, possibility to insert the constant part of the original
   IEEE-1284 ID string. The ID string will also be inserted into the
   PPD file.

 - Added a facility to chnage all the cryptic numerical printer IDs
   from the old PostGreSQL time to clear-text printer IDs. With a
   translation function it is assured that one can still use the old
   IDs, for example to not break links to the old linuxprinting.org
   web site.

 - The Foomatic database uses clear-text printer IDs for all printers
   now.

Ideas for future releases:

 - (Soon) Add support for all PPD extensions for the Commom Printing
   Dialog:
   http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/CommonPrintingDialog,
   http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/PPDExtensions

 - Option conflicts: PPDs allow to define conflicts between option
   settings, so that one cannot set up things which the printer cannot
   do or which dont make sense (Duplex on transparencies, printing
   from tray 4 when only 2 trays are installed, ...).

 - Printer and driver classes: The class XML files should look like
   printer or driver entries, with the same fields and with an
   additional member list. If one marks an option or an option choice
   as being valid for a class, it is valid for all member printers and
   classes, If a printer or driver is a member of a class, all fields
   which are left blank in this entry, are filled in with the value
   defined in the appropriate field of the class. If the class
   contains a comment text, it is shown in addition to the printer's
   or driver's own text. This saves from a lot of duplicate entering
   of data when adding printers, drivers, options, choice, option
   groups, or option conflicts to the database.


General features
----------------

 - The XML database is fully internationalizable, For all
   human-readable strings translations into different languages can be
   added and the web query API allows localized requests with answers
   in the requested language. The OpenPrinting web site appears only
   in English currently. Not only translations can be done but there
   can be also different entries for the same printer driver for
   different regions, so that localized driver packages can get
   offered for automatic download.

 - There is code to manipulate the XML files of the database. You can
   load them and get Perl data structures out of them. You can
   generate a printer overview list which shows all printers and for
   each printer which drivers make this model work and you can also
   generate an XML file with all information needed to use a certain
   printer with a certain driver, which is the basis for the PPD files
   which are used to configure printer queues under a spooler. These
   XML files can also be transformed into a Perl data structure.

 - All XML handling is done by two C programs, one makes use of libxml
   to do a DOM parsing of all types of XML files appearing in the
   Foomatic system to get Perl data structures out of them, because
   Foomatic does all printer configuration, job manipulation,
   printing, and filtering with Perl scripts. The other one does
   XML-to-XML operations: the generation of the printer overview list,
   and the generation of the printer/driver combo files. These
   operations involve reading hundreds of files, cutting them apart
   and assembling them together in another way. To make this as fast
   as possible and also less memory-consuming, we do not use libxml,
   but did the parsing "manually" to keep data moving operations low.

 - All configuration work, especially the generation of the PPD files
   is done by Perl code, because it is much easier to implemnent text
   manipulation operations in Perl.

 - A program foomatic-configure is provided which implements complete
   printer configuration for the common spoolers. It is designed to
   support CUPS, PPR, PDQ, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, and direct spooler-less
   printing and it is designed to make it easy to write GUI or
   automagic printer configuration tools. It also transfers queues
   between different spoolers and generates Perl data structures or
   XML files so that frontends can build menues.

 - The program foomatic-searchprinter finds printers in the local
   database, based on manufacturer/model search terms or the printer's
   device ID. This allows to make scripts which find the printer ID
   and suitable drivers automatically.

 - Printing and managing print jobs is done by foomatic-printjob, you
   supply exactly the same command line options for doing the same
   tasks on every supported spooler.

 - PJL (Printing Job Language) options can be read from the printer
   and added into the local Foomatic database. This allows access to
   many functions of the printer which are not supported by the
   driver, as paper tray selection, toner saving, toner density,
   ... This is done with foomatic-getpjloptions and
   foomatic-addpjloptions. Usually, PJL is only supported by PCL or
   PostScript laser printers.

 - The PPD files serve also for PPD-aware applications as Open Office,
   the GIMP (Gutenprint plug-in and printers not directly supported by
   Gutenprint), GPR, Windows/Mac clients using their PostScript driver
   (and the Linux/Unix server using the Linux driver for the
   printer). They give access to all the driver's options in the
   printing dialogs of said applications. This works for all spoolers.


The upshot of all this is that you can now make changes easily and run
the scripts to calculate out whatever your printer/spooler needs
directly.


Programs and important files from this package
----------------------------------------------

Note: The scripts appear as ".in" files in the source tree and BZR
repository, because the path for the Perl interpreter/the bourne shell
is inserted by the "configure" script.

configure.ac

  The source from which GNU autoconf generates the "configure" script

acinclude.m4

  Additional macros for the "configure" script

make_configure

  Calls aclocal and autoconf to generate "configure" from "configure.ac" 
  and "acinclude.m4"

Makefile.in

  The template from which "configure" generates the Makefile

install-sh

  Helper script for "configure"

foomatic-ppdfile

  This program will compute the spooler-independent Foomatic PPD file
  for any valid printer/driver combo available in the Foomatic
  database, both for printing with foomatic-rip and for
  applications/clients being able to access the printer's
  options. This script serves also as on-the-fly PPD generator for
  CUPS 1.2.x and newer. "make install" creates a symlink named
  /usr/lib/cups/driver/foomatic to this script and so CUPS makes all
  PPDs of the local database available without the PPDs needing to
  exist physically. CUPS automatically calls foomatic-ppdfile if one
  of the PPDs is requested. This way in most printer setup tools (all
  which fully support CUPS 1.2.x and newer) all Foomatic PPDs are
  available, without explicit Foomatic support by the printer setup
  tool.

foomatic-configure

  See USAGE for more info.

  This is the great-grandady of printer configuration programs.

  You can invoke this to configure a printer under any spooler with any
  sort of printer connection.

  The printer can be either one in the Foomatic database, it can be
  one for which you have a PPD file (for example a PostScript printer
  with the PPD from the Windows driver) or a printer which you want to
  use without driver/filter (raw queue).

  It also includes methods to summarize the current configurations, to add
  new queues, reconfigure existing queues, enumerate the printers known to 
  the world, and return xml data objects describing individual printers and 
  drivers.

  It should be very straightforward to write interactive printer
  configuration tools around this script:

  1. foomatic-configure -O prints the XML db overview on stdout
  2. foomatic-configure -Q prints an XML summary of printer queues
  3. foomatic-configure -X prints the XML for a database object
  4. foomatic-configure with various options does the actual setup
  5. foomatic-configure -P prints Perl structures for frontends
  6. foomatic-configure -C copies queues, also to other spoolers
  7. foomatic-configure -D sets a queue as the default queue
  8. foomatic-configure -R removes a queue
	
  foomatic-configure supports CUPS, PPR, PDQ, LPD, LPRng, GNUlpr, and
  direct spooler-less printing nearly completely. The program is 
  structured with a dispatch table; for the cost of a few Perl 
  functions it can support even more spoolers. If not told, it attempts
  to guess which spooler to use, or asks.

  Regarding item (2), the summary of current config.  It shows each
  queue, giving attributes for spooler, and various settings.  Queues
  with the foomatic attribute set to zero are neither queues set up with
  the help of the Foomatic database nor set up with a PPD file (and
  foomatic-rip in case of LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PDQ, or no spooler). These
  queues cannot be modified by foomatic-configure. Trying to modify them
  would turn them into raw queues. The summary shows also which is the
  default queue, if a default queue is defined for the current spooler.
  The $PRINTER environment variable is not taken into account here.

  For all spoolers, foomatic-configure fully groks the configuration
  format. It rewrites the whole thing, preserving ordering, comments,
  etc, and regularizing the syntax on each rewrite.  So it can change
  entries that are clearly foomatic-rip/PPD ones, and leave others
  alone. Also changes of the option default settings done manually (or
  with GUI tools) are preserved when modifying a queue.

  It is wrong to store configuration in a weird place just because foomatic 
  is used: the user should be able to edit the config by hand the
  old-fashioned way...

  When configuring printers, the PPD file is put into 
  /etc/foomatic/<spooler>/ (and if needed symlinked to from elsewhere).
  The PPD files are Adobe-compliant and can also be symlinked/used by 
  applications or clients. They get a basename taken from the queue name.

  For printer configuration frontends it is necessary to get all info
  about the queue configuration, the options, possible settings, and
  default settings. This info can be retrieved as a Perl data
  structure. The structure produced by

     foomatic-configure -q -P > testfile.pl

  can be read by the following Perl script example.pl

     #!/usr/bin/perl
     my @QUEUES;

     eval (join('',(<STDIN>)));

     my $i;
     my $N = $#QUEUES + 1;
     print "$N Queues\n";
     for ($i = 0;  $i < $N; $i++) {
         my $n = $i + 1;
         print "$n : $QUEUES[$i]->{'queuedata'}{'queue'}\n";
     }

  with

     cat testfile.pl | ./example.pl

  Queue copying especially allows to switch between spoolers overtaking
  ones queues with all settings and adjustments.

foomatic-searchprinter

  With this tool it is easy to find the desired printer in the
  database. You do not need to know the exact manufacturer and model
  name and how it is written in the database. foomatic-searchprinter
  matches what is closest to your search term. You can even use the
  IEEE-1284 device ID read from your printer as search term. This
  tool together with foomatic-configure allows to write printer setup
  tools for fully automatic print queue setup. Results are shown
  sorted by relevance and the threshold for accepting results and the
  amount of results to be shown is adjustable. See
  "foomatic-searchprinter -h" for available options.

foomatic-getpjloptions

  Reads the PJL options from local (parallel, USB. serial, ...) or
  remote (only socket, LPD is not bi-directional) printers to standard
  output. They can be piped into foomatic-addpjloptions to add them to
  the database. Call the program without arguments for help.

foomatic-addpjloptions

  Add the PJL options listed by a printer to the Foomatic
  database. The option list is read from a file or from standard
  input. The ID of the printer for which the options are has to be
  provided (option -p). You can add all PJL options or only the most
  important ones (-i). When you are adding the options from a file,
  you are asked whether the printer ID is correct, but you can turn
  this off if you want (-f). Call the program with the -h option to
  get help.

  Note: The program needs the three files foomatic-templates/pjl*.xml

  Example for making available the PJL options of the networked HP
  LaserJet 4050 (Foomatic ID: HP-LaserJet_4050), hostname printer6,
  port 9100:

  # Remove the "native" PJL options from the database
  rm -f `grep -li "pjl" db/source/opt/*.xml`
  # Remove the options from a former PJL option poll on the same printer
  rm -f foomatic-db/opt/pjl-HP-LaserJet_4050-*
  # Get the PJL options from the printer
  foomatic-getpjloptions printer6 9100 | foomatic-addpjloptions -p HP-LaserJet_4050
  # Move the XML files into the database
  foomatic-kitload -k foomatic-db/
  # Set up printer queue
  foomatic-configure -n LaserJet4050 -c socket://printer6:9100/ \
     -d pxlmono -p HP-LaserJet_4050

  Instead of using "foomatic-configure" you can also generate the PPD
  file:

  ./foomatic-ppdfile -d pxlmono -p HP-LaserJet_4050 > lj4050.ppd

  and set up the queue manually as described on
  http://www.openprinting.org/

  For CUPS you can for example do:

  lpadmin -p LaserJet4050 -E -v socket://printer6:9100/ -P lj4050.ppd

foomatic-kitload

  This program installs a foomatic data kit into the local data
  library.  It takes a -k <dirname> option, where <dirname> is the
  toplevel directory of a foomatic driver "kit".  A "kit" is a
  selection of XML source files arranged exactly as in the source/
  section of the master database (ie, opt/ driver/ printer/ subdirs).
  Gutenprint foomatic-generator produces exactly such a kit.

  Foomatic-kitload is moderately paranoid about kits: the kit must
  contain at least one of printer/ driver/ and opt/; the kit must
  contain only files ending in .xml, the kit cannot be the local
  library itself, etc.  But it does not inspect the contents of the
  kit files in any way.

foomatic-printjob

  See USAGE for more info.

  This program implements all the logic for controlling the dynamic
  elements of queues. In other words, jobs. It'll submit them, provide
  status on them, cancel them, etc. This provides an easy way for
  application authors to print in a spooler and driver neutral way.

foomatic-compiledb

  This program will run around and generate combo data for all valid
  printer/driver combinations (or for selected drivers). The data is put
  into one directory and it is generated in a format specified by the user
  (PPD files or printer/driver combo XML files).

  compile_db takes a -j# flag: it will run that many compute processes
  in parallel. You should run compile_db with a -j flag to specify how
  many processes to run concurrently (Gratuitous feature: you can add
  more processes in the middle without conflict! Just run another with
  -f until they all finish).

  Generally, compile_db should just not be necessary except for people
  who want to distribute sets of configuration files. foomatic-ppdfile and
  especially foomatic-configure will automagically compute just what they 
  need at runtime.

foomatic-combo-xml

  The Foomatic accelaration engine written in C, it computes
  printer/driver combo XML files or the printer overview XML file in
  less then two seconds (on a crappy 128MB/350MHz
  machine). foomatic-compiledb needs less than three minutes for its
  job on a two-processor 1GB/1GHz machine. The printer/driver combo
  XML files are computed around 600 times faster than with the pure
  Perl programs of the beginning of the XML Foomatic. In addition,
  foomatic-combo-xml does not need more than 10 MB of memory.

  The program is called by the Foomatic Perl library, but can also be
  called stand-alone, call the program without command line options to
  know how to use it.

  foomatic-combo-xml does not need any XML parsing libraries, to make
  it faster and less memory-consuming, the XML files are somehow
  "manually" parsed.

foomatic-perl-data

  The XML-to-Perl translator, also written in C. This program reads
  the XML files of the Foomatic database and translates them into Perl
  data structures, so that the Perl scripts can access the data.

  The intention of this program is to not need the many non-standard
  Perl XML libraries which would make the installation of Foomatic
  very awkward. Now only the libxml C library is needed, a library
  which ships with most distributions of free operating systems. One
  can use either libxml 1.x (1.8.17 and newer) or 2.x, but 2.x is
  recommended.

  Without any C helper programs the following problems appeared:

  - The thing was *at least* an order of magnitude slower than life
    under Postgres and Perl was. It took hours to run compile_db, and
    up to some minutes (at least a few seconds) to compile one combo.
    The first one took more time as the option cache loaded.

  - Memory: compiledb compute processes peaked at about 150MB RAM.
    You could turn down the number of computations per process, but it
    never got much below 130MB.

  - Due to the slowness of the Perl XML handling an on-disk cache was
    used.  This lead to old files from the cache being used when one
    changed something in the database and forgot to delete the cache.

  - Many non-standard Perl libraries were needed which made the
    installation of Foomatic rather difficult. Now only the libxml C
    library is needed. This library ships with every modern distro of
    GNU/Linux.

foomatic-fix-xml

  Run this program if you have compiled foomatic-perl-data against
  libxml 1.x and you have old database entries with a leading blank
  line. libxml 1.x chokes on leading blank lines.

foomatic-cleanupdrivers

  Removes all driver entries with empty driver command lines. This way
  frontends do not show printer/driver combos which do not work.

foomatic-preferred-driver

  Sets a recommended driver for every printer which has no recommended
  driver entry or has one pointing to a driver which does not exist in
  the local Foomatic database (for example when you have removed a
  driver entry from the database which belongs to a driver which is
  not built into your Ghostscript).

foomatic-nonumericalids

  This script changes all old cryptic numerical printer IDs from the
  old PostGreSQL time to clear-text printer IDs in the installed
  Foomatic database. The current "foomatic-db" has no numerical IDs
  any more (this script has been applied to it), but if you use and
  older Foomatic database (for example to match the of your distro)
  you can change the IDs with this script. With a translation table it
  is assured that one can still use the old IDs.

foomatic-replaceoldprinterids

  Replaces references to old numerical or otherwise obsolete printer
  IDs in arbitrary files. By default it uses the db/oldprinterids file
  of the current Foomatic database as translation table, but you can
  use arbitrary translation tables. You can also give regular
  expressions (Perl) for the text surrounding the IDs. Do
  "foomatic-replaceoldprinterids -h" to know how to use it.

foomatic-ppd-to-xml

  Generates a printer XML file from a given PPD file. This is for
  example used to make database entries for printers for which there
  is a manufacturer-supplied PPD file.

foomatic-printermap-to-gutenprint-xml

  Updates the driver XML file for the Gutenprint driver to the state of
  the foomatic-printermap file in the Gutenprint source tree. Used to
  update the driver XML file for Gutenprint in the OpenPrinting database.

foomatic-ppd-options

  Lists the options in a PPD file one the screen.


Filters
-------

To be able to print with the PPD files and queues made with the stuff
in this package, you need only the foomatic-rip filter provided by the
"foomatic-filters" package.

foomatic-rip

  See the documentation of the "foomatic-filters" package for more info.

  This is a universal print filter which works with all printer
  spoolers auto-detecting the spooler from which it is called. Its job
  is to translate the incoming data (PostScript or PDF in most cases)
  to the printer's native language taking into account all option
  settings, either defaults or job-specific ones. It reads the PPD
  file assigned to the print queue, either a Foomatic-generated one or
  a manufacturer-supplied PPD file of a PostScript printer, uses the
  information to find the default option settings and to build the
  renderer's (usually Ghostscript, "cat" for PostScript printers)
  command line, and applies the user-supplied options. Then it builds
  the renderer's command line and passes the data through it. If the
  data is not PostScript or PDF, a pre-filter ("a2ps", "enscript",
  "mpage", ...) is added.



About the database
------------------

The database is provided by the "foomatic-db" package, additional
database entries are in "foomatic-db-nonfree", drivers can also supply
Foomatic XML files. "foomatic-db" is required for using the programs
provided by this package.

There is a $libdir, somewhere (usually
/usr/share/foomatic/). Underneath $libdir there are (Install
"foomatic-db" at first and then this package. Then the $libdir will be
auto-detected):

 db/                             - the database
 db/oldprinterids                - translation table for old numerical
				   printer IDs and for printer IDs which
				   go changed
 db/kitload.log                  - list of third-party "kit" files, logged
                                   by foomatic-kitload
 db/source/                      - "source" data, provided by humans, etc
 db/source/printer/<poid>.xml    - printer-specific data, one per printer id
 db/source/driver/<driver>.xml   - driver-specific data, one per driver name
 db/source/opt/<idx>.xml         - option data, one file per option
 db/source/PPD/                  - Ready-made PPD files, usually supplied by
                                   printer manufacturers for their PostScript
				   printers.

You can edit the files whenever you want and regenerate the affected
printer queues with foomatic-configure, there is no on-disk cache, the
data is always directly derived from the source files. So your changes
will be taken into account without any special steps.


Foomatic::DB API
----------------

This API isn't required, now that the data is an an easy-to-process
format (nevermind the foomatic-configure language independent "API")
for heathen users of non-Perl languages, but even for such dogs it's
instructive to poke at how certain things are done:

get_driverlist
get_printerlist
get_printers_for_driver
get_drivers_for_printer

  These all return lists of printer id's or driver names.  The
  get_foo_for_bar methods accept a printer id or driver name as
  appropriate; the frst two just return all and take no arguments.

get_overview
get_overview_xml

  This returns an overview listing of all printers, with ids, makes,
  models, functionaliy, drivers, etc.  The various flavors return a
  Perl data structure or XML.

get_makes
get_models_by_make

  These return makes and models lists.

get_javascript2

  This returns a JavaScript function that accepts two widget element
  names.  If the first one is set to a value that euqals a known make,
  then the second one's choices are replaced with a set of models
  valued with printer IDs.  We use this to make a "nested menu" out of
  two menu controls on a web page.

get_printer_from_make_model

  This returns a printer id from a make and model

normalize
normalizename

  These are used for sorts to sort printer model names properly and
  also to do searches for printer models/IDs. normalize makes the
  input string all lower-case, turns a '+' tp 'plus', and removes all
  non-alphanumeric characters. normalizename turns all groups of
  digits to a zero-padded fixed-length number, so that printers with
  the same product line name (like "LaserJet") and different model
  numbers appear in correct numerical order. In addition,
  normalizename also applies normalize.

get_combo_data_xml

  This returns the combined printer/driver data for a particular
  combination.  Arguments are driver and printer id.

  The "combo" operation is less trival than it looks; be careful when
  messing with it. It took us hours to get right... Currently, it is
  implemented in the foomatic-combo-xml.c C accelerator.

get_printer_xml
get_printer
get_driver_xml
get_driver

  These return the information in the printer info or driver info
  database files. The *_xml functions produce XML, the others Perl
  data structures.

find_printer

  This function returns Foomatic printer IDs to match a given search
  term. The search term can be manufacturer and model, separated by a
  space or a '|', an IEEE-1284 device ID of a printer, manufacturer,
  model, Foomatic printer ID, or parts of any of the mentioned items.

getdat

  This returns a Perl data structure of all the data for a given
  printer/driver combo. It contains a description of printer
  capabilities, all options, choices, and ranges valid for this
  particular combo. It is used to build the PPD files, but can also
  be used by Perl frontends. It takes driver and printer ID arguments;
  just like get_combo_data_xml

getppd

  This returns the spooler-independent PPD file for foomatic-rip and for 
  applications and clients. It takes no arguments; instead you must call 
  getdat first, and they'll then magically find that result. 

getdocs
getexecdocs
get_summarydocs

  For some reason there are three functions which return documentation
  about job options for particular printer/driver pairs. There's also a 
  fourth one inside foomatic-rip (invoked by the "docs" option).

  These work the same way as getppd; you call getdat first.

  Once, these worked if you called getdat with only a driver; in that
  case it sort of documented it for all printers at once. This is
  sort of incomplete, especially what with PJL arguments in the world.
  Grant also probably broke it in the xml rewrite. Till has
  rewritten getexecdocs to produce documentation for a given printer
  driver pair, it provides the data presented on the "Execution Details"
  pages of OpenPrinting.
  
get_libdir

  Returns the library directory.


Dependencies
------------

Besides Perl and a C compiler with its standard libraries you will
need the libxml C library for XML handling and one of the tools
"wget"/"curl".

In addition, you need the Foomatic database ("foomatic-db") and the
Foomatic filters ("foomatic-filters") packages. It is recommended to
install these packages before you install this package. Then the paths
to their components get auto-detected during the build of this
package.

"wget" (from www.gnu.org) is really a standard tool which nearly every
distribution includes.

Because libxml is also used by GNOME, it is probably also part of
every distribution of GNU/Linux or *BSD and one can also easily build
it on any Unix-like operating system. If you distribution does not
provide libxml you can get libxml from

   http://www.xmlsoft.org/

If your distribution contains libxml, note that besides the "libxml"
or "libxml2" package you must install also a package with a name
"libxml-devel" or "libxml2-devel" to be able to compile programs which
use libxml. This additional package contains the needed header files
and "xml(2)-config", which tells the C compiler where it finds the
header files. If "xml(2)-config" or some header files in the packages
of your distribution are missing, compile libxml from source.

The versions 1.8.17 and 2.4.19 of libxml are tested, both work, but
1.8.17 requires that the XML files do not have leading blank
lines. Use foomatic-fix-xml if you have such XML files (old or
third-party files).

Using libxml 2.x is highly recommended.

You need libxml 2.x, aclocal (in the "automake" package in some
distros), and autoconf when you want to compile Foomatic from the BZR
repository.

See the USAGE file for compilation details.


Data
----

There are three main source datafiles (printers, drivers, and options;
annotated examples:


printer/HP-LaserJet_4000.xml
============================

# The printer file contains information specific to a particular
# printer.

<printer id="printer/HP-LaserJet_4000">

# Make and model are not internationalized.  There will eventually be
# an "alias" mechanism, but the need is different.

  <make>HP</make>
  <model>LaserJet 4000</model>

# According to the Adobe specifications for PPD files every PPD file
# must contain a unique DOS-compatible file name (the "*PCFileName"),
# a file name with an up to 8 characters log base name and an up to 3
# characters long extension, and upper and lower case letters being
# considered as equal. As every PPD file is for a printer/driver
# combo, we let the first 6 characters being provided by the printer
# entry:

  <pcmodel>HPLJ4K</pcmodel>

# The first two characters should be the manufacturer prefix as listed
# in Appendix D of Adobe's "PostScript Printer Description (PPD) File
# Format Specification Version 4.3", available on

# http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf

# Various stuff about the machine

  <mechanism>

# Printer types can be <laser />, <led />, <inkjet />, <dotmatrix />,
# <impact />, <sublimation />, <transfer />, <thermal />. Other types
# we have to add to the CGI script on OpenPrinting to make the web
# interface displaying them properly.

    <laser />

# At some point we can make color be less of a boolean flag and more
# of a section full of goodies.

    <!--not "color"-->
    <resolution>

# In theory this is a list.  In practice We've only got one per
# printer which is the maximum resolution the manufacturer claims for
# this printer. Do not put empty tags (like "<x></x>" or "<x />" here
# if the resolution is not known. Leave out the tags (or the whole
# <resolution> section).

      <dpi>
        <x>1200</x>
        <y>1200</y>
      </dpi>
    </resolution>

    <consumables>

# Information about ink, drums, etc.
# The comments are supposed to be qualitative ("Separate drum and
# toner cartridges")

      <comments>
        <en>toner</en>
      </comments>

# There can be <partno>12A1975</partno> elements with manufacturer
# part numbers for the various carts, etc it takes. Unfortunately,
# this is not made use of, one could make a consumable database with
# this for example.

# The lang section.  In practice this will be only minimally useful;
# 
#  - Backends can pstops the ps down a level if needed
#  - Backends know if pjl options apply
#  - Backends can know if direct text printing will work

# The autodetection stuff

  <autodetect>

# There are three ways to auto-detect a printer, via the parallel port
# (<parallel>...</parallel>), the USB (<usb>...</usb>), or SNMP
# (TCP/Socket-connected printer, <snmp>...</snmp>). Through these
# interfaces the printers report back an IEEE-1284-complient ID string
# from which the fields "MFG" (<manufacturer>...</manufacturer>),
# "MDL" (<model>...</model>), "DES" (<description>...</description>),
# and "CMD" (<commandset>...</commandset>) are used. The string itself
# can be put between <ieee1284>...</ieee1284> tags, but all items
# which are not constant for all printers of this model, as the serial
# number ("SERN:...;") and the device status ("VSTATUS:...;") have to
# be removed here. As the ID string is usually the same for all
# detection methods, one can put the entries between
# <general>...</general> tags, then the <parallel>...</parallel>,
# <usb>...</usb>, and <snmp>...</snmp> are only used for
# differences to the data between the <general>...</general> tags. A
# complete entry could look like:
#
#  <autodetect>
#    <general>
#      <ieee1284>MFG:HEWLETT-PACKARD;MDL:DESKJET 600;CMD:MLC,PCL,PML;CLASS:PRINTER;DESCRIPTION:Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 600;</ieee1284>
#      <commandset>MLC,PCL,PML</commandset>
#      <description>Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 600</description>
#      <manufacturer>HEWLETT-PACKARD</manufacturer>
#      <model>DESKJET 600</model>
#    </general>
#  </autodetect>
#

# If you use CUPS, you get the device IDs of all locally connected
# (USB, parallel) printers and of printers in the local network by
# running:

lpinfo -l -m

# On Linux you find this info for the parallel ports (/dev/lp<N>, <N>
# = 0, 1, 2, ...) in the files
#
#   /proc/sys/dev/parport/parport<N>/autoprobe*
#
# for the USB under Linux it is more complicated, easiest is to use a little
# Perl script, called "getusbprinterid.pl":
# You need to find the IOCTL call value to pass to the perl ioctl function.
# Here is a little C program that does this. This is easier than trying to
# use p2h and convert the *.h files to perl.

# The following optional section describes with which drivers this
# printer works. A valid printer/driver pair can be defined by either
# adding the printer to the driver's printer list (the way how it
# worked all the time) but also by adding the driver to the printer's
# driver list. This way a printer can get associated with a driver for
# which there is no driver XML file and a driver can list a supported
# printer which is not in the printer XML database. For providing a
# PPD file both printer and driver XML files must exist, but it is not
# important in which of the two the printer/driver relationship is
# defined.

# The driver list in the printer XML files was introduced for once
# defining links to ready-made PPD files (relative paths without "/",
# "http:", "https:", or "ftp:" in the beginning are relative to
# $libdir/db/source/, absolute links can point to external sites, as
# for example the site of a printer manufacturer, but they must always
# provide the non-interactive download of the PPD file, for example
# via "wget") and second, listing the supported drivers for
# visitor-contributed printer entries (from web input form). The
# comments section is for adding comments specific to the
# printer/driver combo. As it is human-readable it is
# internationalized. Each driver entry here must have a driver ID. PPD
# file link and comment are optional.

    &lt;i&gt;1200x1200 dpi only possible with Windows drivers,
    600x600 can be reached w/o particular software.
    The difference is visible, but only slightly, so
    the Functionality got &quot;Mostly&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    Do the following:&lt;p&gt;

    Set the resolution on the front panel to &quot;Prores 1200&quot;, not
    to &quot;Fastres 1200&quot;. When you use CUPS with HPs PPD file, turn
    off &quot;Fastres 1200&quot; in the printer configuration
    options.&lt;p&gt;

    Try the generic PostScript PPD file which comes with KUPS 1.0 or newer.

driver/md2k.xml
===============

The driver files contain information about drivers.  There are a few
things, but the two biggies are the prototype and the printers list

<driver id="driver/md2k">
 <name>md2k</name>

# According to the Adobe specifications for PPD files every PPD file
# must contain a unique DOS-compatible file name (the "*PCFileName"),
# a file name with an up to 8 characters log base name and an up to 3
# characters long extension, and upper and lower case letters being
# considered as equal. As every PPD file is for a printer/driver combo,
# we let the last 2 characters being provided by the driver entry:

 <pcdriver>M2</pcdriver>

# The drivers listed by the OpenPrinting database are usually not
# developed by OpenPrinting.  Most free software printer drivers come
# from independent projects, initiated by peopke who want to get their
# printers to work under Linux, some other drivers come from the
# printer manufacturers. So even if OpenPrinting hosts a downloadable
# package of the driver the development of the driver is not part of
# OpenPrinting. Therefore every driver entry has to contain a
# reference to the developers of the driver, where the driver can be
# actually downloaded. The appropriate link goes into the <url> tag:

 <url>http://plaza26.mbn.or.jp/~higamasa/gdevmd2k/</url>

# The driver XML files can contain the following tags to describe the
# driver's properties, so that a user can easily find the driver which
# is most suitable for him. The properties are shown in the gray
# driver info boxes on the OpenPrinting web site and they are also
# supposed to be shown by printer setup tools when they offer to
# download a driver from OpenPrinting. It is especially important to
# supply them if a downloadable driver package or PPD files are
# supplied.

# Supplier's name, internationalization (with <en>...</en><de>...</de>...)
# optional

#   <supplier>SpliX project</supplier>

# Does the driver come from the printer's manufacturer or from a third
# party. The third form tells also the manufacturer names of the
# printers which are from the manufacturer which developed the
# driver. If there are also printers from other manufacturers
# supported (like for the PCL driver HPIJS) then the OpenPrinting web
# site does not show this driver as manufacturer-supplied on the pages
# of the printers of other manufacturers.

#   <thirdpartysupplied />   OR   <manufacturersupplied />   OR
#   <manufacturersupplied>HP|Apollo</manufacturersupplied>

# License name. Here should be put the common short name or
# abbreviation if the license is one of the common free software
# licenses. Otherwise it should contain something short and
# descriptive, for non-free drivers simply "Commercial". The license
# name can be internationalized with language tags
# (<en>...</en><de>...</de>...).

#   <license>GPL</license>

# The license text does not need to be supplied for common free
# software licenses. It should be supplied if:
#
#  - The license is not free (<nonfreesoftware /> tag set)
#  - The driver has patent issues (<patents /> tag set, describe the
#    patent issues here in that case)
#  - The license of the driver is free but none of the common licenses
#    (<nonfreesoftware /> tag not set)

#   <licensetext>
#    <en>
#      ...
#    </en>
#   </licensetext>

# License texts can also be linked from external sites:

#   <licensetext>
#    <en url="http://www.laserstar.com/licenses/en/gl-series-eula.txt" />
#    <de url="http://www.laserstar.com/licenses/de/gl-series-eula.txt" />
#    ...
#   </licensetext>

# License texts have to be given always as plain text, UTF-8-encoded.

# Mark with this tag whether the driver is non-free software

#   <nonfreesoftware />

# All driver entries without this tag are considered to be free
# software.

# This tag tells whether there are any patent issues with the driver

#   <patents />

# The absence of the tag tells that the driver is free of patent
# issues.

# If a driver entry provides a <licensetext> and is <nonfreesoftware
# /> or with <patents /> printer setup tools which download this
# driver are supposed to present the license text and ask the user
# whether he agrees with it.

# Printer manufacturers could want to package their drivers for
# different market regions (Europe, Asia/Pacific, Americas, ...) as
# the markets demand different capabilities of printer drivers and
# different user-settable options (CJK-language-related stufff for
# example). So there could even be two different driver flavors for
# the same printer but adapted to different regions. To express these
# driver properties there are special tags.

# For each flavor of the driver a separate driver entry (driver XML
# file) has to be supplied. There is no requirement of certain
# properties of the driver flavors to be equal or not. Especially the
# printer lists can contain printers which are not in all flavors, for
# example if printers are only sold in certain regions. To mark which
# entries are belonging together one adds a group tag to each XML
# file, with the same group name, but the name must be different to
# the names of all already existing groups. A locales tag contains all
# language/country codes for which the driver flavor is intended:

#   <group>epson-inkjet</group>
#   <locales>de en_UK en_IE fr_FR es_ES</locales>

# The codes in the locales tags should be different for the group
# members, to allow to automatically select the most suitable flavor
# if the detected printer is supported by more than one flavor.

# For downloadable drivers support contacts should be given, so that
# users get informed before they do the download and do not complain
# at their OS distribution vendor if the driver downloaded from
# OpenPrinting does not work. The human-readable string for the
# support contact can be internationalized with language tags
# (<en>...</en><de>...</de>...).

# This is an internationalized short description of the driver,
# typically one line, to be used in the gray driver info boxes, in the
# driver overview list, and also by printer setup tools. If a driver
# entry is for a development version of a driver, tell it here, as the
# long description is not shown everywhere.

#   <shortdescription>
#    <en>
#     Driver for Samsung SPL2 (ML-1710, ...) and SPLc (CLP-500, ...) laser
#     printers
#    </en>
#   </shortdescription>

# If there are downloadable packages for this driver entry on the
# OpenPrinting web site, a <packages> section has to be supplied. This
# tag tells which package files on the OpenPrinting web server belong
# to this driver or on which external server to find packages for this
# driver. It also allows assigning files or locations to different
# components of this driver and to assign scopes to them. Scopes can
# be: "general", "gui", "printer", "scanner", "fax", ... Uses the
# "general" scope if packages are not split. Wild cards are the same
# as used for file masks in the shell (NOT regular expressions). They
# must match both Debian and RPM package file names. Note that between
# file name and version number is a "-" for RPMs and a "_" for Debian
# packages.

#   <packages>
#    <package scope="general">*splix[_-]1.[0-9].[0-9]*</package>
#   </packages>

# It is possible to give absolute paths which can point to external
# sites, as for example the site of a printer manufacturer, so that
# the package can be hosted there but auto-downloaded via
# OpenPrinting. Important is that these packages are auto-downloadable
# LSB packages and that a non-interactive download is provided (should
# also work with utilities like "wget"). Licenses which the users have
# to agree on have to get supplied in the driver XML file. Printer
# setup tools are supposed to ask the user for agreeing if the driver
# is marked as non-free or with patent issues.

# Example for packages provided by an external site:

#   <packages>
#    <package scope="general" fingerprint="http://download.example.com/printerdrivers/gpg/key-fingerprint.txt">http://download.example.com/printerdrivers/RPMS/i486/*laserstar*;http://download.example.com/printerdrivers/RPMS/x86_64/*laserstar*;http://download.example.com/printerdrivers/debian/dists/lsb3.2/main/binary-i386/*laserstar*;http://download.example.com/printerdrivers/debian/dists/lsb3.2/main/binary-amd64/*laserstar*</package>
#   </packages>

# Note that more than one mask can be supplied separating them with
# semicolons (";").

# The masks with absolute paths must match all package files, of all
# architectures (usually i386/i486 and amd64/x86_64) and all package
# systems (RPM and Debian). Use more than one mask if needed. On your
# server each directory with package files inside must be browsable,
# so that a client can expand the wildcards. In addition the packages
# itself need to be readable for everyone so that they can get
# downloaded.

# Note also that the packages on the external server must be in
# regular package repositories, so that automatic updates with the
# package manager tools provided by the user's Linux distribution
# (currently apt, yum, and zypper) can be performed. The configuration
# data for the local tools is derived from the actual file locations,
# which get determined by the masks.

# Important is also that with paths (absolute starting with "http://",
# "https://", or "ftp://" and relative simply having at least a slash
# somewhere) wildcards can only be used after the last slash ("/"). So
# wildcards are only allowed for the file name and not for the
# directory names.

# If the packages are signed, all packages of the same <package> entry
# should be signed with the same key and the key should be registered
# on the key server network. The key fingerprint should be made
# available as a text file on the web site of the driver issuer and
# the site should be with an SSL certificate which has been signed by
# an official registrar. The "fingerprint=..." parameter should then
# provide the link to the file with the key fingerprint. The link must
# be an "https://..." URL and point to a file on a server of the
# driver issuer. Packages must be signed for fully automatic upload by
# default on Linux distributions. See also

# https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/writingandpackagingprinterdrivers

# The <functionality> section should make it easier for a user to
# compare different drivers by giving some technical properties and
# ratings (0...100) for common document types, system load, and
# execution speed. The higher the number, the better the driver
# performs here. It is not required to supply all items. Items can be
# left out or can stay empty. <functionality> sections of the same
# format can also be used in the <printer> entries in the <printers>
# list, to describe exceptions for particular printers. If an item is
# left out or empty there, the appropriate item in the general
# <functionality> section is used, so only the items which are
# different for the given printer need to be listed.

#   <functionality>
#    <maxresx>1200</maxresx>
#    <maxresy>1200</maxresy>
#    <color />   OR   <monochrome />
#    <text>100</text>
#    <lineart>100</lineart>
#    <graphics>100</graphics>
#    <photo>80</photo>
#    <load>50</load>
#    <speed>90</speed>
#   </functionality>

# Not all tags are required here, if the valur for a tag is not known,
# the tag has to be left out. Do not put empty tags (like
# "<text></text>" or "<text />" here.

# The <execution> section describes everything needed to execute the
# driver.

 <execution>

# Sometimes it is possible that a driver depends on another driver,
# for example a manufacturer publishes a core driver which is
# completely free software and supports most of their printer. In
# addition, he publishes closed-source plugins for the core driver to
# support additional printers where they cannot open the driver code
# for IP reasons. He wants to link in all his driver packages for
# automatic download with the <packages> tags. To make everything work
# correctly he creates one driver entry for the core driver and one
# for each plugin. The printers which do not need the plugin get
# listed as supported by the core driver, the printers needing a
# plugin are listed as supported by the plugin. To avoid that then
# only a plugin gets automatically downloaded one adds a <requires>
# tag to each entry of a plugin, to the beginning of the <execution>
# section:

#    <requires version="&gt;= 5.0.1">gutenprint</requires>
#    <requires version="&gt;= 2.7.10">hpijs</requires>
 
# The version attribute is optional, without, every version is
# accepted. Optional relationships (>=, <=, =, <, >) allow to not only
# accept the given version. The '>´ and '<' have to be replaced by the
# appropriate XML entities, as described earlier here for other text
# in the XML files. More than one <requires> tag is allowed.

# Driver types are 
#
#  <ghostscript /> : The driver code is compiled into Ghostscript
#
#  <ijs /> :         IJS plug-in. These are raster drivers which connect
#                    to the IJS interface of the renderer, usually of 
#                    Ghostscript but also of pdftoijs or others. The
#                    interface is based on pipes and is bi-directional.
#                    It makes the driver independent of the renderer.
#
#  <cups /> :	     CUPS Raster driver. The raster driver standard
#                    introduced by CUPS. The renderer generates the CUPS
#		     Raster format, a bitmap format optimized for printing,
#		     and it gets piped into the driver.
#
#  <opvp /> :        OpenPrinting Vector driver. DLL and IPC interface for
#                    plugging printer drivers into the renderer. This is
#                    the only solution of mudular printer drivers for high-
#                    level graphics (vector) PDLs.
#
#  <uniprint /> :    A uniprint driver, consisting of one or more .upp
#                    files for Ghostscript.
#
#  <filter /> :      The driver code is a separate executable and the 
#                    driver does not fit into the groups listed above, 
#                    usually either a filter which converts generic 
#                    bitmap output of Ghostscript to the printer's 
#                    language, or a wrapper around Ghostscript.
#
#  <postscript /> :  A driver which has PostScript as output (for 
#                    PostScript printers). It usually does not call
#                    Ghostscript but only applies the user's option
#                    settings to the data stream. But Ghostscript can
#                    be called here, too, as for downgrading to a lower
#                    PostScript level or for handling PDF input.
#
# The driver type only provides information for the web pages (or
# driver auto-download facilities of printer setup tools), it is not
# used when generating PPD files.

   <ghostscript />

# The driver's <execution> section can also contain a
#
# <nopjl />
#
# which suppresses the usage of PJL options (options which send PJL
# commands to the printer). This is done with drivers where the driver
# itself already produces a PJL header and where the PJL options
# defined for the supported printers would badly interfere. In most
# cases this is not needed, as foomatic-rip merges the PJL headers of
# the driver and of the PJL options.

# And the driver's <execution> section can also contain a
#
# <nopageaccounting />
#
# This suppresses the inserting of page accounting code (for CUPS)
# into the PostScript data stream. Some drivers lead to unexpected
# behavior with that. Especially for the generic PostScript drivers
# (which do not use Ghostscript in most cases) the accounting code
# should not be inserted.

# The prototype defines what command the backends run to drive this
# printer. It must take at least PostScript, preferably both PDF and
# PostScript on stdin and generate the printer's native language on
# stdout. Various %A, %B, etc substitution "spots" are specified; this
# is where substition options will be placed.

# if there is only a <prototype> and not a <prototype_pdf> entry,
# foomatic-rip will feed both PostScript and PDF into the command line
# defined with <prototype>, otherwise for PostScript input the
# <prototype> command line is used and for PDF input the
# <prototype_pdf> command line. Both are defined the same way and the
# same command line snippets are inserted from the option settings.

# If there is only a <prototype> defined, PDF will only be fed in if
# the command line begins with "gs " (this means Ghostscript is called
# and Ghostscript understands both PostScript and PDF) and there are
# no options based on inserting active PostScript code into the input
# data stream. Otherwise foomatic-rip converts PDF input to PostScript
# at first and feeds the PostScript through the command line.

# The printer list is a simple list of printers that this driver works
# with. Alternatively, one can tell that a given printer works with a
# given driver also by a <drivers> list in the printer's XML file (see
# above).

 <printers>

  <printer>
   <id>printer/Alps-MD-4000</id><!-- Alps MD-4000 -->
  </printer>
 </printers>
</driver>

# In the printer list it is also possible to place comments or
# exceptions in the driver's functionality (see above) specific to a
# certain printer/driver pair:

#  <printer>
#   <id>printer/HP-LaserJet_4050</id><!-- HP LaserJet 4050 -->

#    <en>to 1200dpi</en>
#   </comments>
#   <functionality>
#    <monochrome />
#   </functionality>
#  </printer>

# Note that printer/driver relationships can also be expressed by
# adding the driver to the <drivers> lists of the appropriate printer
# XML files.

================

# Every option exists independently from printers or drivers, because
# they might apply to arbitrary combinations of printers and/or
# drivers.  In practice, some drivers have wholly unique options
# (gutenprint for example), while others (lots of generic basic
# Ghostscript drivers, for example) share some options.

<option type="enum" id="opt/2">

# Options are of a type "enum", "bool", "int", "float", "string", or
# "password", options have an ID.  The id is also the filename.

# The shortname is a spaceless short name for the thing.  It must not
# contain / or : (otherwise it will not be handled correctly in PPD
# files). It should be one of the standard Adobe PPD option names if
# apropriate

  <arg_shortname>

# Various things here, and all <comments>, are internationalized.
# They take the usual posix locale codes in the form xx[_YY], where xx
# is a two-letter iso language code, and YY is two-letter country code
# to distinguish differing national dialects.
#
# Generally the national dialects won't be very common or necessary
# here.  The backends currently require that <en> content be provided.

   <en>PageSize</en><!-- backends only know <en> shortnames! -->
  </arg_shortname>

# The longname is a short phrase describing the thing in more detail
# GUI tools usually show longnames

  <arg_longname>
   <en>Page Size</en>
  </arg_longname>

# The <comments> are used to form documentation.  In theory these can
# become man pages or the like. Example:

#   <comments>
#    <en>
#     This option allows the user to get a lighter or darker printout, but
#     keeping totally black areas black and not making white areas gray.
#    </en>
#   </comments>

  <!-- A multilingual <comments> block can appear here, too;
       it should be treated as documentation for the user. -->

# The execution section describe how the backend should execute this
# option. The order and spot apply to the *driver*'s prototype for
# <arg_substitution /> (once called commandline) style options, or
# just the order applies for <arg_postscript /> and <arg_pjl />
# options. The order and the <arg_section> go into the "*OrderDependency"
# line of the appropriate option entry in the PPD file, for this example
# one would get

#    *OrderDependency: 100 DocumentSetup *PageSize

# When no <arg_section> is given, "AnySetup" is used as a default.

# For <arg_substitution /> options the <arg_proto> is inserted into
# the driver's command line, at the spot (e. g. "%A") whose letter is
# given between the <arg_spot>...</arg_spot> tags, the <arg_proto> of
# an <arg_postscript /> option is a snippet of PostScript code which
# is inserted into the PostScript data stream of the job, for
# DSC-conforming PostScript into the section specified with
# <arg_section>, otherwise in the beginning. The <arg_proto> lines of
# <arg_pjl /> options are PJL commands which are sent to the printer
# before the output of the driver's command line is sent. Because this
# only works reliably when the driver output does not have its own PJL
# command header, these options are ignored when the driver's XML file
# is marked with a <nopjl /> tag in its <execution> section. Drivers
# which produce their own PJL and therefore are marked with <nopjl />
# are for example "hpijs" and "hl1250". There is also the
# <arg_composite /> execution style for composite options, see the
# "Composite Options" section below. The user's value gets put into
# the <arg_proto>'s %s location. 

# The <arg_group>...</arg_group> tags put the option into the PPD
# option group named here. In many PPD-based GUIs ("kprinter", "xpp",
# OpenOffice.org, ...) every group is shown as a tab or a tree branch
# containing the member options of this group. You can also specify
# subgroups. Then you have to use a "group path" similar to directory
# paths, with the group and subgroup names separated by slashes
# (<arg_group>General/Paper</arg_group> is the "Paper" subgroup in the
# "General" group). Subgroups are not recommended as there is no GUI
# supporting them. If an option is member of a composite option (See
# "Composite Options" section below), the <arg_group>...</arg_group>
# tags will be ignored.

# The constraints define what printer/driver combinations this option
# applies to.  The *most specific* constraint rules the day; it's
# "sense" says whether or not the option is "in".  The winning
# constraint also provides the default value used when this option
# applies to that printer and driver.

# Constraint elements are: driver, make, model.  The driver is the
# driver name, or not present to apply to any driver.  The make is the
# printer make, or not present to apply to any printer make.  The
# model is the driver model, or not present to apply to any printer.
# Instead of make/model, you can also specify <printer>id</printer>.

# IMPORTANT: The make and model must match the one in the printer xml
# definition, and everywhere else in the other options. One needs to
# write a utility to change printer names sensibly.

# It is illegal to have a model with no make.

# It is illegal to have none of make/model/driver.

# It is illegal to have *no* constraints, or at least such options are
# never used.

# For enum options, the defval is the id of the enum_val that is the

# To allow custom page sizes to be used one has add a choice with the
# "<ev_shortname>" being "Custom" to the "PageSize" option (example
# below). This choice will be treated as the custom page size. When
# the user selects this choice, he has to provide the width and the
# height of the page in addition. These values are converted into
# PostScript points (1/72 inches) and inserted into placeholders in
# the "<ev_driverval>" of this choice. The "<ev_driverval>" should
# contain a placeholder "%0" for the page width and "%1" for the page
# height. Alternatively the "<ev_driverval>" can contain two zeros
# ("0") from which the first will be replaced by the page width and
# the second by the page height. Then one gets Adobe-compliant entries
# for the custom page size in the PPD files and one can set a custom
# page size with the following commands:

# CUPS: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
# LPRng: lpr -P huge -Z PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
# GNUlpr: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
# LPD: lpr -P huge -JPageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
# PPR (RIP): ppr -P huge -F "*PageSize Custom" --ripopts 500x750cm
#          bigposter.ps
# PPR (Int.): ppr -P huge -F "*PageSize Custom" -i 500x750cm bigposter.ps
# PDQ: pdq -P huge -oPageSize_Custom -aPageWidth=500
#          -aPageHeight=750 -oPageSizeUnit_cm bigposter.ps
# No spooler: foomatic-rip -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm
#	   bigposter.ps

# Here is an example for a custom page size setting:

#   <enum_val id="ev/PageSize-Custom">
#    <ev_longname>
#     <en>Custom size</en>
#    </ev_longname>
#    <!-- A multilingual <comments> block can appear here, too;

#    </ev_shortname>
#    <ev_driverval>%0 %1</ev_driverval>
#   </enum_val>

# The entry

#    <ev_driverval>0 0</ev_driverval>

# would have the same effect as the <ev_driverval> of the example.

# For numerical (int, float) and bool options there is no <enum_vals>
# section. Instead of this section numerical options have tags to
# specify minimum and maximum value:

#  <arg_max>10.0</arg_max>
#  <arg_min>0.0</arg_min>

# For the %s in the <arg_proto> a number, either the user's choice
# when he has specified this option or the default value is
# inserted. Only numbers between the minimum and the maximum and in
# case of int options only integer numbers are allowed.

# Bool options can be set or not be set. There <arg_proto> will be
# inserted if they are set, nothing if they are not set. A %s in the
# <arg_proto> is not allowed, there is nothing to insert for it. As
# <arg_defval> in the option's constraints one can use 0 for not
# setting the option by default or 1 for setting it by default.

# Bool options need the specification of a name for the case when they
# are not set. This will be used by GUIs and in PPD files:

#  <arg_shortname_false>
#    <en>CorrectBlack</en><!-- Backends only know <en> shortnames! -->
#  </arg_shortname_false>

# This name should not contain spaces, ":", or "/".

# See below for string, password, and composite options.


Composite Options
-----------------

This is an option type to make it easier for users to choose the best
settings for a certain printing task, even if the driver has very many
options. The idea is to have an enumerated choice option which does
not directly modify something in the driver's command line but sets
several of the other options.

One example is the "PrintoutMode" option which will be made available
for all printer/driver combos which have at least one option regarding
the printout quality or document type. 

The possible choices should be the same for every printer and driver,
so that users (especially newbies) can bring their printers in the
right mode by choosing one easy to understand item from a menu instead
of having to switch several cryptic driver options. For now the
choices are the following:

   Command line  GUI                Intention
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Draft         Draft              Very fast, ink/toner-saving printout
   Normal        Normal             Quick standard quality printout
   High          High Quality       High quality for plain paper
   VeryHigh      Very High Quality  Highest quality for plain/inkjet paper
   Photo         Photo              Highest quality for photo paper

These choices can also have one of the following modifiers:

   Modifier      Intention
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   .Gray         Grayscale printing on a color printer
   .Mono         Monochrome printing (no grayscales, black or white)

Examples:

   Command line   GUI                      Comment
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   High.Gray      High Quality Grayscale
   Photo          Photo                    Color photos on color printer
   VeryHigh.Mono  Very High Quality Monochrome  Really black text in
                                           highest quality on inkjet
                                           printer, not suitable for
                                           halftone images.
   Normal         Normal                   Standard color in 300/360 dpi
                                           on normal paper, grayscale
                                           on black-and-white printers

Not all choices/combinations of basic choices and modifiers must be
present. Often modes are simply not available on certain
printer/driver combos, as "Photo" on most lasers. It is highly
recommended to have "Normal" available, though (and having this the
default).

The GUI names can have additional remarks in parantheses, for example
when manual intervention (other cartridge, photo paper) is needed.

To add such an option to the database, one only needs to add an option
XML file like the one below into the db/source/opt directory of the
database. The file db/source/opt/pcl3-PrintoutMode.xml could look
like this:

  </enum_vals>
</option>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shown option is only an example, it is neither in the BZR
repository nore will it work with all printers which use the "pcl3"
driver. You can paste it into a file (make the <ev_driverval>s being
one line, the items separated by spaces) and copy it to db/source/opt/
to try it out.

The "<arg_composite />" tag for the execution style specifies it as a
composite option. The <arg_spot> and <arg_proto> are meaningless in a
composite option and the "<ev_driverval>"s contain a space-separated
list of all settings of which the pre-made configuration represented
by this choice consists. Every choice of the composite option must set
EXACTLY THE SAME individual options. In no choice it is allowed to
leave out one of them. These individual options are the member options
of the composite option. Not all options of a driver/printer combo
need to be member options of the composite option. It is not allowed
to have one option being member of more than one composite option. The
composite option must be an enumerated choice option, the member
options must be enumerated choice or boolean options. Member options
can even be composite options, so composite options can be nested.

It is enough to add a composite option as shown. The PPD generator
(getppd() in lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, package "foomatic-db-engine") will
take care of the rest. It will

   - Order all member options into a group (PPD group, see "Option
     Grouping" below) named after the composite option.

   - Add to every member option the choice "Controlled by '<name of
     the composite option>'" and make this choice the default. If this
     is chosen, the composite option will set the value for this
     member, depending on what value is chosen for the composite
     option. If the user chooses something else than "Controlled by
     '<name of the composite option>'" the member option does not obey
     the setting given by the composite option. So the advanced user
     can also set the member options individually.

   - If necessary the <arg_order> and <arg_section> of the composite
     option is replaced by other values in the PPD file, so that the
     composite option will be stuffed into the PostScript data stream
     always before all its member options. Do not give "0" as the
     order number to any of the member options.

A composite option can also span only one (but not zero) member
option. This is for example done with the "PrintoutMode" option of the
HPIJS driver ("foomatic-db-hpijs" package). This driver has only one
option for setting resolution and quality, but this option has
sometimes many choices with rather cryptic names. The "PrintoutMode"
maps to the most important choices with the above-mentioned names, and
in addition, these names are the same as of the "PrintoutMode" options
of other drivers, so the user finds the important printing modes more
easily.

The facility of composite options can also be used for other things
than for a "PrintoutMode" option, for example a finisher could be
controlled by a composite option (to have the most common finishing
tasks as "Bound booklet", "Stapled booklet", "Letter in envelope",
...).


Forced Composite Options
------------------------

Forced composite options are very similar to composite options, but the
user cannot set the individual member options, but only the composite
option (the user is forced to use the composite option). This allows
options acting at two or more places.

Example: A printer driver is a filter which converts a generic bitmap
produced by Ghostscript to the printer's native format. The command
line for converting PostScript to the printer's language could look like this

gs -q -dBATCH -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bitcmyk -r600 -sOutputFile=-
- | filter -size=<width>x<height>

where <width> and <height> is the page size in points (1/72
inches). In addition, Ghostscript needs to know the page size. For
this one usually puts the following PostScript code into the
PostScript input file:

<</PageSize[<width> <height>]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice

where <width> and <height> is again the page size in points. So we
need two options for setting the page size, one PostScript option to
set the page size for Ghostscript and one command line option to set
the page size for the filter. The user would have to change both when
he wants to print on another paper size, and it does not make sense to
have different settings for the two. So one could make the "PageSize"
option a composite option of the two, but then the GUI exposes an ugly
"PageSize" group with the two individual options. To avoid this, one
uses a forced composite option ("Forced" because the user is forced to
use the composite option, the individual member options are not
accessible).

Assuming that the name of the PostScript option for the page size is
"GSPageSize", the name of the page size option for the filter is
"filterPageSize" and both have the choices "A4", "Letter", and
"Legal", the forced composite option named "PageSize" would look as
follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<option type="enum" id="opt/filter-PageSize">

    </ev_shortname>
    <ev_driverval>GSPageSize=A4 filterPageSize=A4</ev_driverval>
   </enum_val>
  </enum_vals>
</option>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This looks exactly like a usual composite option and works also the
same way. The only difference is that instead of an "<arg_composite
/>" tag "<arg_forced_composite />" is used. If the PPD generator finds
such an option, it hides the member options by only using
"*Foomatic..." keywords to describe them, not any standard PPD
keywords as "*OpenUI...", "*OrderDependency...", ... This way
PPD-aware graphical frontends do not see the member options but
foomatic-rip has all information from them to run the driver
correctly.


String and Password Options
---------------------------

These options allow the user to supply nearly arbitrary strings
(within limits of length, characters and structure) to the printer
driver, for example names of color calibration files, fax numbers,
passwords for confidential jobs, ... Frequently needed strings can be
added as enumerated choices, so a frontend can show the option as a
combo-box. The enumerated choices are also used for frontends which
only support options as defined by the PPD spec. So having enumerated
choices is highly recommended for most of these options.

In the XML database string and password options look similar to
enumerated choice options. The differences are the option types
"string" or "password" and the additional tags to restrict the
possible strings.

The "<arg_maxlength>" tags give a length limit, it should once not
allow strings longer than around 100 characters, as otherwise
foomatic-configure could generate a line longer than the allowed 255
characters in the PPD file when setting the default value, and second,
which is very important, it should not allow strings which are too
long for the printer filter or driver so that buffer overflows cannot
occur. Not using the "<arg_maxlength>" tags makes arbitrary long
strings to be accepted, this is not recommended.

With "<arg_allowedchars>" the accepted strings can be restricted to
contain only the characters given in the list. This restrictions does
not only avoid that the filter chokes on a wrong option, it serves
mainly for security reasons, for example to avoid a string like "|| rm
-rf * ||" for a command line option. So if the option prototype does
not quote the string, command delimiter characters, I/O re-directors,
and shell special characters (";", "|", "&", "<", ">", "*", "?", "[",
"]", "{", "}", "(", ")", "$", "\", "'", """) should not be allowed. If
the string is quoted by the option prototype, the closing quote
character and the backslash should not be allowed, so that one cannot
escape from the quoting. The allowed characters are checked by a
"/^[...]*$/" expression in the Perl scripts, so ranges with "-", a
list of forbidden characters with a leading "^", or special characters
as "\w", "\d", "\x07", ...  are allowed. To allow a backslash, one has
to escape it by using two backslashes ("\\"). To allow a "-" it must
be in the end of the list to not make it defining a range and for a
"^" must be placed at any other place than the beginning of the string
if it should be explicitly allowed.

"<arg_allowedregexp>" allows also to restrict the structure of the
string, as it defines an arbitrary Perl regular expression (see "man
perlre") which has to be matched by the string. This serves also for
having only strings which are usable by the filter and which do not
destroy the command line structure. With this one can for example
forbid a backslash as the last character to avoid escaping the closing
quote of the option prototype. Regular expressions are applied via a
'/.../' expression in the Perl scripts. To apply the pattern matching
modifiers "i", "m", "s", or "x" (as "/.../i" for case-insensitive
matching) begin the regular expression with "(?<modifiers>)" (as
"(?i)..." for case-insensitive matching).

It is highly recommended to use at least one of "<arg_allowedchars>"
and "<arg_allowedregexp>", as otherwise all characters are allowed in
the user-supplied string and so a malicious user can execute arbitrary
shell or PostScript commands. If both tags are used, both conditions
have to be fulfilled.

Note that for the character lists and regular expressions in the XML
files the following character substitutions have to be done:

   < --> &lt;
   > --> &gt;
   " --> &quot;
   ' --> &apos;
   & --> &amp;

Here is an example for an option to supply the file name for an ICC
profile for the "foo2zjs" driver (this option is neither in the CVS
for the Foomatic database nor tested with this driver):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<option type="string" id="opt/foo2zjs-ICM">

	...

    </enum_vals>
</option>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This option allows to choose either one of the given file names,
either by using the "<ev_shortname>"s or the "<ev_driverval>"s, or one
can give every arbitrary other file name with a maximum length of 127
characters, only containing letters, digits, periods, underscores,
dashes, and slashes, and not having a slash in the end (no
directories). Note that in Perl the period must be escaped by a
backslash to be taken literally, otherwise it stands for an arbitrary
character. The regular expression for blocking out strings ending with
a slash is "(?<!\/)$" (see "man perlre", search for "(?"). Here the
slash is quoted by a backslash. In the XML file the "<" is replaced by
"&lt;" so that the XML structure does not get broken. foomatic-rip
translates this back before applying the regular expression.

To be able to offer strings as an enumerated choice which are not
allowed as an option name in a PPD file, the "<ev_shortname>" may
differ from the "<ev_driverval>", the string inserted at the "%s"
place holder in the "<arg_proto>" is always the "<ev_driverval>",
independent whether the user supplies the "<ev_driverval>" directly or
the "<ev_shortname>". In this example both

   lpr -o ICM= file.ps

and

   lpr -o ICM=None file.ps

supply an empty string as the value of the ICM option.

For the default value there must be an enumerated choice, if there is
none, the PPD generator will create one. So this entry is allowed
(this option is only an example, it is not in the CVS of the Foomatic
database):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<option type="password" id="opt/Password">
  <!-- A multilingual <comments> block can appear here, too;
       it should be treated as documentation for the user. -->
  <arg_longname>
   <en>Password (for confidential jobs)</en>
  </arg_longname>
  <arg_shortname>
   <en>Password</en><!-- backends only know <en> shortnames! -->
  </arg_shortname>
  <arg_execution>
   <arg_group>General</arg_group>
   <arg_order>100</arg_order>
   <arg_spot>B</arg_spot>
   <arg_substitution />
   <arg_proto> --pass=%s</arg_proto>
  </arg_execution>
  <arg_maxlength>30</arg_maxlength>
  <arg_allowedchars>A-Za-z0-9\.,_\+\=\:-/</arg_allowedchars>
  <constraints>
     <constraint sense='true'>
      <driver>mydriver</driver>
      <arg_defval></arg_defval>
     </constraint>
  </constraints>
</option>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default value is an empty string here. So the PPD generator will
add a choice for the empty string.

Normally, automatically added choices get the same "<ev_shortname>" as
the string itself, but if the string is not allowed as an option name
in a PPD file, the "<ev_shortname>" will be modified. For an empty
string (as in the example above) "None" will be used and all
characters except numbers, letters, and underscores ("_") will be
replaced by underscores.

The option types "string" and "password" are treated exactly the same
way by the PPD generator and by foomatic-rip, the different names
are only for frontends to know whether the input field should display
the typed characters or asterisks on the screen.


CUPS Custom Options
-------------------

CUPS defines several extensions to the PPD specifications to support
the functionality of modern printers:

http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.4/spec-ppd.html

There are extensions for so-called "Custom Options" where instead of
given enumerated choices freely choosable custom values can be
supplied. As Foomatic's numerical, string, and password options can be
implemented as CUPS custom options in the PPDs as well, the PPD
generator does both implementations in the PPDs. There are the
"*Foomatic..." keywords generated, as before, but also the CUPS PPD
extension, consisting of the keywords "*Custom<option>" and
"*ParamCustom<option>" keywords. This way GUIs which are aware of
CUPS' custom options give full access to Foomatic's numerical, string,
and password options.

foomatic-rip understands also PPD files now which describe custom
options only by the CUPS extension and not with "*Foomatic..."
keywords.

Allowed characters and regular expressions for string and password
options cannot be described by CUPS PPD extensions. So CUPS-aware GUIs
will allow input of strings which do not match these restrictions, but
foomatic-rip will let the option fall back to the default value in
such a case. This way the security is assured.


Option Grouping
---------------

All options should be put in groups (with the tags
"<arg_group>...</arg_group>" in the "<arg_execution>" section of the
option XML files, see above). This way many GUIs sort the options into
tabs or tree branches according to the groups. This way one gets only
the most important options on the first tab and not so often needed
ones on additional tabs. This also overrides the automatic option
grouping of CUPS (Groups "General" and "Extra").

It is recommended to have the options in groups as follows (plus
perhaps special groups, but not one group for every option):

General

  Here go options which are most used on a job-by-job basis, as the
  options for paper type, size, and tray, ink type, duplex, ... and
  all options affecting the printout quality, as resolution,
  dithering, ... and especially "PrintoutMode". If a "PrintoutMode"
  option is present, all quality-related options covered by the
  "PrintoutMode" option go into the automatically created
  "PrintoutMode" group (see above). And this is intended, these
  options are now usually controlled by "PrintoutMode" and so they are
  not the most important options for the first tab any more.

  Do not put color/brightness/gamma, ... options here, they go to
  "Adjustment".

  Options typically to go here are:

    o PageSize
    o InputSlot
    o MediaType
    o InkType
    o Duplex
    o PrintoutMode
    o Resolution
    o REt
    o Dither
    o FastRes
    o Economode
    o ...

  All options mentioned after "PrintoutMode" will usually be used as
  member options for "PrintoutMode", they are only in this group when
  there is no "PrintoutMode" option.

PrintoutMode

  This group only exists if there is a "PrintoutMode" option, because
  it is generated by this option. It contains the member options of
  "PrintoutMode". Typical candidates are

    o Resolution
    o REt
    o Dither
    o FastRes
    o Economode
    o ...

  They do not need an "<arg_group>PrintoutMode</arg_group>" line, they
  are put into this group automatically. You should better put an
  "<arg_group>General</arg_group>" line into these options, so that
  they go into the "General" group when there is a printer/driver
  combo for which no "PrintoutMode" option applies.

Adjustment

  Options for correcting the appearance of colors, contrast, ..., for
  head alignment, ... etc. Here most numerical options will go, but
  also things like "Density", also if it is an enumerated choice
  option. Typical candidates are:

    o Gamma
    o Brightness
    o Contrast
    o Density
    o Saturation
    o Cyan
    o Magenta
    o Yellow
    o ...

Finishing

  If a printer has a stapler, folder, cutter, envelope packer, or
  similar devices to do additional processing on the ready printout,
  the options to control this stuff go into this group. Examples:

    o Stapling
    o Binding
    o Cutting
    o Booklet
    o ...

Miscellaneous

  Options which do not fit into the mentioned groups and for which it
  is not worth to make a special group.


Unprintable margins
-------------------

On most printers you cannot print arbitrarily close to the borders of
the paper. You usually will have margins of certain width on which you
cannot print. For filters and application programs to know about these
margins PPD files have "*ImageableArea" lines which define the
positions of the lower, the upper, the left, and the right borders of
the area on which the printer can print. There is one line for each
paper size listed in the "*PageSize" option.

To conveniently generate these lines one can use the following XML
structure in the Foomatic database entries:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<margins>
     <general>
       <!-- The margins here are valid for every paper size for -->
       <!-- which there is no "exception" section -->
       <!-- ---------- -->
       <!-- possible units: -->
       <!-- pt, in, mm, cm,
       <!-- dotsNNNdpi (NNN: resolution in which dots are counted) -->
       <!-- if "unit" not present, default unit is pt -->
       <!-- ---------- -->
       <!-- if a margin is not present, default width is used -->
       <!-- ---------- -->
       <!-- a missing "general" section assumes the default borders as the -->
       <!-- general borders and "pt" as the default unit for -->
       <!-- "exceptions". -->
       <!-- ---------- -->
       <!-- Default margin widths: 1/4 inch left/right, 1/2 inch top/bottom -->
       <unit>pt</unit>
       <top>9</top>
       <bottom>36</bottom>
       <left>18</left>
       <right>18</right>
     </general>
     <exception PageSize="Photo4x6TearoffTab">
       <!-- if one or more of "unit", "top", "bottom", "left", -->
       <!-- "right" is missing, the appropriate item of the "general" -->
       <!-- section is used -->
       <top>0</top>
       <left>0</left>
       <right>0</right>
     </exception>
     <exception PageSize="A4">
       <!-- It is also possible to give absolute values in PostScript -->
       <!-- coordinates where the origin is the lower left corner. To -->
       <!-- do so, the <absolute /> tag has to be added, otherwise -->
       <!-- the values are the widths of the unprintable margins -->
       <absolute />
       <left>10</left>
       <right>585</right>
     </exception>
     <exception PageSize="...">
       ...
     </exception>
     ...
<margins>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This structure is allowed in printer entries in the "<mechanism>" 
section and in driver entries in the "<execution>" section or inside a 
"<printer>" entry of the driver's printer list. In the "<execution>" 
section of a driver entry the margins are valid for all printers used 
with this driver, in a "<printer>" entry they apply only to the given 
printer/driver combo.

The shown example could be for the HP PhotoSmart 7150/7350, which does 
full-bleed only on HP's special photo paper with an 0.5 inch wide 
tear-off tab on the lower border (and some other paper sizes used in the 
photo tray). On all other paper sizes the printer leaves white borders 
of half an inch at the top and at the bottom and a quarter of an inch on 
the left and right hand side (1 inch are 72 pt). In addition, the page 
size "A4" allows to print up to 10 points to the left and the right borders.

At first we give the general borders ("<general>" section) where we 
choose the unit "pt" (PostScript points) for the numbers. These borders 
are valid for all paper sizes which are not explicitly mentioned with an 
"<exception ...>" section. For our printers one of the exceptions is the 
4x6 photo paper with the tear-off tab (including the tab the paper is 
4x6.5 inches large). here the printer prints up to the left, right, and 
top borders. Therefore we have margins of zero here. At the lower border 
the printer still leaves half an inch white (therefore probably HP 
introduced the tear-off tab), so we keep the 36 pt of the "<general>" 
section by not mentioning a new lower border. For A4 we redefine the 
left and the right border. This is also possible in absolute PostScript 
coordinates measured from the lower left corner, as we do here. We 
indicate this with the "<absolute />" tag. The left border is at 10 pt 
from the left, and as A4 paper is 595 pt wide, the right border is at 
585 points from the left.

One hint for the choice of the units: Float numbers as border widths are 
allowed, but it is recommended for having exact info to choose a unit 
which gives integer numbers for the widths (which is always possible 
with the "dotsNNNdpi" unit with NNN being the maximum resolution of the 
printer).

A "<margins>" section in a printer entry should represent the printer's 
hardware capabilities. Such a section in a driver entry should represent 
how the driver's limitations are. If there are margins defined in both 
the printer and the driver entry of the desired printer/driver combo, 
the more restrictive (wider) borders count. If there are no border 
definitions in both the printer and the driver entry, the borders are 
assumed to be of the default widths.


Adding arbitrary extra entries to the PPD file
----------------------------------------------

The "<ppdentry>" tags allow to add extra lines to the PPD file. The 
tags can be put into the top level ("<printer>") of a printer XML entry, 
into the "<execution>" section of a driver XML entry, or into the 
"<printer>" entries of the printer list in a driver XML file. They serve 
mainly to put a default resolution into PPD files for drivers without 
"Resolution" option. Examples:

"hpijs"  driver, default resolution for HP DeskJet 350. For this driver 
the default resolution depends on the printer class. Therefore the 
appropriate "<ppdentry>"s have to be in the printer entries of the 
printer list:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<driver id="driver/hpijs">
  <name>hpijs</name>
  ...
  <printers>
   <printer>
    <id>printer/HP-DeskJet_350C</id><!-- HP DeskJet 350C -->
    <ppdentry>
      *DefaultResolution: 600dpi
    </ppdentry>
    <margins>
     <general>
      <unit>in</unit>
      <relative />
      <left>0.25</left>
      <right>0.25</right>
      <top>0.125</top>
      <bottom>0.67</bottom>
     </general>
     <exception PageSize="A4">
      <left>0.135</left>
      <right>0.135</right>
     </exception>
    </margins>
   </printer>
   ...
  </printers>
</driver>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

"pnm2ppa" driver: This driver has no "Resolution" option, and all 
printers print in 600 dpi with it. So we put the "<ppdentry>" into the 
"<execution>" section:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<driver id="driver/pnm2ppa">
  <name>pnm2ppa</name>
  <url>http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa/</url>
  <execution>
   <filter />
   <prototype>gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dPARANOIDSAFER -dBATCH -r600%A%Z 
-sOutputFile=- - | pnm2ppa%C%B -i - -o -</prototype>
   <ppdentry>
    *DefaultResolution: 600dpi
   </ppdentry>
  </execution>
  ...
</driver>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that leading spaces are removed from the lines between the
"<ppdentry>" tags before they get inserted into the PPD file.

The lines are added at the end of the PPD file header, right after the
lines for the basic hardware capabilities of the printer.


Example for a Foomatic-generated PPD file
-----------------------------------------

Below is an example PPD file, the PPD file for the HP Color LaserJet 4550
used with the "pxlcolor" driver. It was generated with the command line

   ./foomatic-ppdfile -p HP-Color_LaserJet_4550 -d pxlcolor

The structure is completely Adobe-compliant and no relevant
information is in comments. Besides the usual keywords which one finds
in PPDs there are some special ones beginning with
"*Foomatic...". These keywords are read by foomatic-rip and contain
all information to build the renderer's command line. See explanations
for these keywords below the example file.

If a printer has auto-detection information in the Foomatic database,
the manufacturer and model names from there are inserted in the
"*Manufacturer:" and "*Product:" fields and the IEEE-1284 ID string is
put into the "*1284DeviceID:" field.

Independent whether there is auto-detection information, there is an
additional "DRV:" field in the "*1284DeviceID:" which contains driver
properties. These properties are put here, so that they appear in
CUPS' PPD/driver overview listings ("lpinfo -l -m"). This way a
printer setup tool can show the driver properties in a driver overview
without needing to generate and read the PPD files. The following
properties are available (comma-separated):

   D: Driver name
   R: Driver Recommended for this printer (0, 1)?
   M: Driver supplied by the Manufacturer (0, 1)?
   O: Driver marked Obsolete in the OpenPrinting database (0, 1)?
   F: Driver is Free software (0, 1)?
   P: Driver has Patent issues (0, 1)?
   S: Support contacts (c: commercial, v: voluntary, u: unknown, more than 
      one possible)
   T: Driver Type: G: Ghostscript built-in, C: CUPS-Raster, I: IJS,
      O: OpenPrinting Vector, F: Filter, U: Ghostscript Uniprint,
      P: PostScript
   X: Maximum X resolution of the driver in dpi
   Y: Maximum Y resolution of the driver in dpi
   C: Does the driver support Color printing (0, 1)?
   t: Rating for Text document printing with this driver (0 ... 100)
   l: Rating for Line art document printing with this driver (0 ... 100)
   g: Rating for Graphics document printing with this driver (0 ... 100)
   p: Rating for Photo document printing with this driver (0 ... 100)
   d: Rating for system loaD caused when printing with this driver (0 ... 100)
   s: Rating for processing Speed of this driver (0 ... 100)

The "DRV:" field in a device ID looks like this:

*1284DeviceID: "MFG:Hewlett-Packard;MDL:HP LaserJet 4050 Series;CMD:PJL,MLC,PCL,
PCLXL,POSTSCRIPT;DES:Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4050 Series;DRV:Dljet4,R0,M0,F1,Sv,TG,X600,Y600,C0,t90,l90,g60,p30,s90;"

If there is no device ID for a printer, the "*1284DeviceID" will
contain only the "DRV:" field.

The PPDs contain the driver properties also in clear text, like this:

*driverName ljet4/ljet4 - Built-in Ghostscript driver for PCL 5e laser printers: ""
*driverType G/Ghostscript built-in: ""
*driverUrl: "http://www.ghostscript.com/"

    <name>: Option name;
    <value>: default value, only needs to be in
            the allowed range, does not need to be
	    one of the enumerated choices.

*FoomaticRIPJobEntityMaxLength: <integer value>
*FoomaticRIPUserEntityMaxLength: <integer value>
*FoomaticRIPHostEntityMaxLength: <integer value>
*FoomaticRIPTitleEntityMaxLength: <integer value>
*FoomaticRIPOptionsEntityMaxLength: <integer value>
    <integer value>: Maximum length for the substitution strings for
    the special entities "&job;", "&user;", "&host;", "&title;", and
    "&options;" which can be used in the quoted strings of all "*Foomatic..."
    keywords (foomatic-filters 4.0.6 or newer needed).

All strings in quotes (Foomatic command line, snippets to insert in
command line, "<code>" in the keyword descriptions above) are encoded
with the "htmlify()" function of DB.pm, so they contain no forbidden
characters ("<", ">", "\"") any more. In addition they are broken up
into short lines. The filter (foomatic-rip) will put them together
at first and then replace the HTML/XML entities by the original
characters. If a string is split up, an "*End" line follows, as
required by the Adobe specification. In the quoted strings also the
following special entities can be used to insert job parameters:

   Entity          Gets replaced by
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   &job;           Job ID
   &user;          User name (who sent the job)
   &host;          Job host name
   &title;         Job title
   &options;       Job options
   &copies;        Number of copies
   &rbinumcopies;  "%RBINumCopies:" of PostScript input
   &year;          Job rendering date: 4-digit year
   &month;         Job rendering date: 2-digit month
   &date;          Job rendering date: 2-digit day of month
   &hour;          Job rendering date: 2-digit hours (24 hours)
   &min;           Job rendering date: 2-digit minutes
   &sec;           Job rendering date: 2-digit seconds

foomatic-rip substitutes these entities by the appropriate parameters
before starting the rendering process. This way job parameters can be
sent to the printer. From foomatic-filters 4.0.6 on the length of the
inserted strings can be limited, either by the above-mentioned
"*FoomaticRIP...EntityMaxLength:" keywords in the PPD or by adding the
length to the entities (ex: "&user8;", "&title16;", ...). If the
string to insert for the entity is longer than the limit, it gets cut
off to the limit. Note that adding numbers to the entities makes the
PPD incompatible with older versions of foomatic-rip. PPDs with the
above-mentioned new keywords work with older versions of foomatic-rip,
but limits do not get applied. Therefore I generally recommend using
the PPD keywords for PPDs to make them publically available.

All Foomatic-relevant info is stored with keywords beginning with 
"*Foomatic...", not in comment lines. So if some program strips the 
comments off the PPD file, the file still works. The data is stored 
in a way compliant to the Adobe specification.

The "*Foomatic..." lines are located in the option entries, so that all 
info which is related is located close to each other. This makes the 
file more easily readable. The lines also contain only the information 
which is not provided by the standard PPD lines. So redundancy is low 
and the PPD can more easily be edited and customized.

"*Foomatic..." lines are given to all non-PostScript options and to
numerical or string/password PostScript options. Usual "Boolean" and
"PickOne" PostScript options do not need them. Numerical and
string/password options are "PickOne" for most frontends, but with the
"*Foomatic..." lines the server (the foomatic-rip filter script)
identifies them as numerical or string/password options (and so
accepts values which are not listed) and, second, frontends could also
read the "*Foomatic..." lines and so show the options as numerical or
string (with input field, slider, combo box) or even as password
(input field which shows asterisks instead of the actually typed
characters), as KDE Print and XPP now do by reading the Perl
structure.

Non-PostScript options with only one choice consist only of
"*Foomatic..." lines. So the one choice is stored in the PPD file but
frontends will not show a widget for these options.

Also composite options can be described more easily:

*End

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remark to the "*FoomaticRIPDefault<name>: <value>" entries for
numerical options:

Adobe's PPD specs do not support numerical options. Therefore the
numerical options are mapped to enumerated options in the PPD file and
their characteristics as a numerical option are stored in
"*Foomatic..."  keywords. Especially a value between the enumerated
fixed values can be used as the default value. Then this value must be
given by a "*FoomaticRIPDefault<option>: <value>" line in the PPD
file. But this value is only valid, if the "official" default given by
a "*Default<option>: <value>" line (it must be one of the enumerated
values) points to the enumerated value which is closest to this
value. This way a user can select a default value with a tool only
supporting PPD files but not Foomatic extensions.  This tool only
modifies the "*Default<option>: <value>" line and if the
"*FoomaticRIPDefault<option>: <value>" had always priority, the user's
change in "*Default<option>: <value>" had no effect.

For numerical, string, and password options there are also the CUPS
PPD extensions for custom options used. This allows GUIs which use
CUPS' PPD extensions give full access to these options to the
user. See above.

Foomatic Combo XML

Compute a Foomatic printer/driver combo by a pure C program doing
a simplified sequential-reading XML-parsing. Perl libraries which
make Perl data structures out of the XML files are very slow and
memory-consuming.

Foomatic Perl Data
------------------

Compute the Foomatic Perl data structures out of the
printer/driver combo XML file or overview XML file as generated
by foomatic-combo-xml.c. Compute also a Perl data structure from
printer and driver entries of the Fommatic database.

The Foomatic Perl data structure for the printer/driver combos is
the basis for all spooler-specific config files and PPD files and
also the data structure used by the filter Perl scripts.

The other Perl data structures are used by the Foomatic Perl library
to do the database operations provided by its API.

This program is based on the libxml2 and this is a retianol way to
make a C data structure from a single XML file. This structure is then
converted to Perl

Functions to read out localized text, choosing the translation into the
desired language. Reads also simple text without language tags, for
backward compatibility for the case that a not yet localized database
field gets localized. The second function is especially for license text.
It returns always the English (original) version in addition and allows
links to text files as alternative to the text itself, as often license text
has to be in its own file.
