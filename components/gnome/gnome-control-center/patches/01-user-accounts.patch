Remove user-accounts panel on Solaris since we don't have pwquality library.

Not suitable for upstream as is - would need to convert to check if pwquality
is present and if not, then disable the module.

Even if that's resolved, we'd need to deal with panels/user-accounts/run-passwd.c
which currently execs /usr/bin/passwd and looks for the responses it expects
from the Linux passwd command, instead of using PAM or similar for Solaris.

If this panel is ever restored, then you will also need to remove
../gnome-shell/patches/07-account-settings.patch to restore its menu entry.
