Because the cups is testing the woking dirs on start for right mask and
group ownership then fix those attributes it might happen the:
 # pkg verify -v cups
will report changes against the package. To avoid of this the following
test should be performed on built package after uprev:

 - stop cupsd
  # svcadm disable svc:/application/cups/scheduler:default

 - install new (nightly) packages:
  # pkg change-facet --no-backup-be version-lock.library/print/cups-libs=false version-lock.print/cups=false
  # pkg install --no-backup-be -g <nightly-repo> pkg://nightly/library/print/cups-libs pkg://nightly/print/cups

 - pre-test verify the package
  # pkg verify -v cups

 - start cupsd
  # svcadm enable svc:/application/cups/scheduler:default

 - verify the package
  # pkg verify -v cups

If the directory masks are changed after start then pkg-attribs in cups.p5m
should be fixed accordingly.
