      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

OpenPrinting CUPS v2.4.12

Introduction
------------

OpenPrinting CUPS is the most current version of CUPS, a standards-based, open
source printing system for Linux® and other Unix®-like operating systems.  CUPS
supports printing to:

- [AirPrint™][1] and [IPP Everywhere™][2] printers,
- Network and local (USB) printers with Printer Applications, and
- Network and local (USB) printers with (legacy) PPD-based printer drivers.

CUPS provides the System V ("lp") and Berkeley ("lpr") command-line interfaces,
a configurable web interface, a C API, and common print filters, drivers, and
backends for printing.  The [cups-filters][3] project provides additional
filters and drivers.

CUPS is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0 with an exception to allow
linking against GNU GPL2-only software.  See the files `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`
for more information.

> Note: Apple maintains a separate repository for the CUPS that ships with macOS
> and iOS at <https://github.com/apple/cups>.

Reading the Documentation
-------------------------

Initial documentation to get you started is provided in the root directory of
the CUPS sources:

- `CHANGES.md`: A list of changes in the current major release of CUPS.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the CUPS project.
- `CREDITS.md`: A list of past contributors to the CUPS project.
- `DEVELOPING.md`: Guidelines for developing code for the CUPS project.
- `INSTALL.md`: Instructions for building and installing CUPS.
- `LICENSE`: The CUPS license agreement (Apache 2.0).
- `NOTICE`: Copyright notices and exceptions to the CUPS license agreement.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `REPORTING_ISSUES.md`: Instructions what information to provide when reporting an issue.

Once you have installed the software you can access the documentation (and a
bunch of other stuff) online at <http://localhost:631/> and using the `man`
command, for example `man cups`.

If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located under
the `doc/help` and `man` directories.

*Please read the documentation before asking questions.*


Setting Up Printers
-------------------

CUPS includes a web-based administration tool that allows you to manage
printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  Open <http://localhost:631/admin/>
in your browser to access the printer administration tools.  You will be asked
for the administration password (root or any other user in the "sys", "system",
"root", "admin", or "lpadmin" group on your system) when performing any
administrative function.

The `lpadmin` command is used to manage printers from the command-line.  For
example, the following command creates a print queue called "myprinter" for an
IPP Everywhere printer at address "11.22.33.44":

    lpadmin -p myprinter -E -v "ipp://11.22.33.44/ipp/print" -m everywhere

The `-p` option specifies the printer name.  The `-E` option enables the printer
and accepts new print jobs immediately.  The `-v` option specifies the *device
URI* for the printer, which tells CUPS how to communicate with the printer.  And
the `-m` option specifies the model (driver) to use, in this case the IPP
Everywhere ("everywhere") driver that is used for AirPrint and IPP Everywhere
printers as well as shared printers and printers supported through Printer
Applications.

Legacy printers are supported using PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files
that describe printer capabilities and driver programs needed for each printer.
CUPS includes several sample PPD files for common legacy printers:

   Driver                       | PPD Name
   -----------------------------|------------------------------
   Dymo Label Printers          | drv:///sample.drv/dymo.ppd
   Intellitech Intellibar       | drv:///sample.drv/intelbar.ppd
   EPSON 9-pin Series           | drv:///sample.drv/epson9.ppd
   EPSON 24-pin Series          | drv:///sample.drv/epson24.ppd
   Generic PCL Laser Printer    | drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd
   Generic PostScript Printer   | drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd
   HP DeskJet Series            | drv:///sample.drv/deskjet.ppd
   HP LaserJet Series           | drv:///sample.drv/laserjet.ppd
   OKIDATA 9-Pin Series         | drv:///sample.drv/okidata9.ppd
   OKIDATA 24-Pin Series        | drv:///sample.drv/okidat24.ppd
   Zebra CPCL Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebracpl.ppd
   Zebra EPL1 Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep1.ppd
   Zebra EPL2 Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep2.ppd
   Zebra ZPL Label Printer      | drv:///sample.drv/zebra.ppd

The sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally do not
exercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  Other drivers provide
greater printing capabilities.

You can run the `lpinfo -m` command to list all of the available drivers:

    lpinfo -m

Similarly, the `lpinfo -v` command lists the available printers and their device
URIs:

    lpinfo -v

Once you know the device URI and driver name, add the printer using the
`lpadmin` command:

    lpadmin -p PRINTER-NAME -E -v "DEVICE-URI" -m DRIVER-NAME


Printing Files
--------------

CUPS provides both the System V `lp` and Berkeley `lpr` commands for printing:

    lp FILENAME
    lpr FILENAME

Both the `lp` and `lpr` commands support printing options:

    lp -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi FILENAME
    lpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi FILENAME

CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript, and text
files, so you can print those files directly rather than through an application.

If you have an application that generates output specifically for your printer
then you need to use the `-oraw` or `-l` options:

    lp -o raw FILENAME
    lpr -l FILENAME

This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.

vcnet/regex/README

This is a modified version of Henry Spencer's "BSD" regular expression
library. The original library can be found at
https://github.com/garyhouston/regex.  A description of Spencer's
various libraries can be found at https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/

The changes in this version are:

* The library name has been changed to rxspencer, the header installs
  into a directory rxspencer, and the man pages named accordingly, to
  allow easy installation as a system library on Linux without
  conflicting with other regex libraries.
* A CMake build system, which can build either static or shared
  libraries, maybe even on non-Unix systems.
* A few code modernizations and changes to improve portabilty, avoid
  compiler warnings, and improve robustness.

I (Gary Houston) originally made this version with a build system
based on GNU Automake and Libtool, to allow building a shared library
for a project where the library needed to be dynamically loaded. The
CMake scripts were contributed by Stephen Just, modified from LuaDist
versions.

Spencer's original license can be found in the COPYRIGHT file. The CMake
scripts are licensed under the MIT license. I release all of my own
changes to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero license.

Installation
============

CMake needs to be installed. To build from a Linux command line, or
something compatible, within the source directory:

to configure for a static library:
cmake .
or
cmake -Drxshared=0 .

to configure for a shared library:
cmake -Drxshared=1 .

to disable tests:
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF .

to disable manuals/ documentation:
cmake -DINSTALL_DOCS=OFF .

to build:
make
make install

also required on Linux, after installing the shared library:
ldconfig

to run the tests:
make test

to run the tests, with output displayed:
ctest -V

Usage
=====

Include the following header in a C program:

#include <rxspencer/regex.h>

Link with the library using the -lrxspencer flag, as in:
gcc test.c -o test -lrxspencer

The library is further described in the supplied man pages: rxspencer.3
and rxspencer.7, which are formatted at
https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/regex3.html and
https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/regex7.html.

Note: This program began life as the "ippserver" sample code that first

different kinds of IPP services and multiple services per instance - the
"ippeveprinter" program exposes a single print service conforming to the
current IPP Everywhere specification, thus the new name.
