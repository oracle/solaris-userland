The issue was reported to upstream
https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6111

The Mercurial test suite is failing on Solaris and so are the two modules I
believe. The problem is that remotefilelog and fsannotate extensions are using

fcntl.flock(lockfd, fcntl.LOCK_EX)

flock is not implemented on Solaris, so python is emulating the behavior via
fcntl F_SETLKW.

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/fcntlmodule.c
420   ret = fcntl(fd, (code & LOCK_NB) ? F_SETLK : F_SETLKW, &l);

But fcntl needs to have the lockfd file opened for writing as documented in
fcntl(2):

       An  exclusive lock will prevent any other process from setting a shared
       lock or an exclusive lock on any  portion  of  the  protected  area.  A
       request  for an exclusive lock will fail if the file descriptor was not
       opened with write access.

The extensions are opening the file as O_RDONLY. Changing that to O_RDWR makes
the test suite to pass. The fcntl module is not opening the files but rather
it's getting the fd from caller, so I believe that the fix should go to
mercurial.
