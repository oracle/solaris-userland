[ImageMagick®](https://imagemagick.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php) software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file [formats](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php), including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and PDF.

## What is ImageMagick?

ImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.

ImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The main website for ImageMagick can be found at [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/). The source code for this software can be accessed through a [repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). In addition, we maintain a legacy version of ImageMagick [version 6](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/).

Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php).

## Features and Capabilities

One of the key features of ImageMagick is its support for scripting and automation. This allows users to create complex image manipulation pipelines that can be run automatically, without the need for manual intervention. This can be especially useful for tasks that require the processing of large numbers of images, or for tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis.

In addition to its core image manipulation capabilities, ImageMagick also includes a number of other features, such as support for animation, color management, and image rendering. These features make it a versatile tool for a wide range of image-related tasks, including graphic design, scientific visualization, and digital art.

Overall, ImageMagick is a powerful and versatile software suite for displaying, converting, and editing image files. Its support for scripting and automation, along with its other features, make it a valuable tool for a wide range of image-related tasks.

Here are just a few [examples](https://imagemagick.org/script/examples.php) of what ImageMagick can do:

[Examples of ImageMagick Usage](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/), demonstrates how to use the software from the [command line](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php) to achieve various effects. There are also several scripts available on the website called [Fred's ImageMagick Scripts](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/), which can be used to apply geometric transforms, blur and sharpen images, remove noise, and perform other operations. Additionally, there is a tool called [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) that allows users to access the functionality of ImageMagick without having to install the software on their own systems. Finally, the website also includes a [Cookbook](http://im.snibgo.com/) with tips and examples for using ImageMagick on Windows systems.

## News

Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/). As of ImageMagick version 7.1.1-16, you can choose and customize one of these [security policies](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php): Open, Limited, Secure, and Websafe.

By default, ImageMagick supports up to 32 channels. As of ImageMagick version 7.1.1-16, you can enable up to 64 channels by adding the **--enable-64bit-channel-masks** option to the Linux configure build script. For Windows this will be enabled automatically.


Want more performance from ImageMagick? Try these options:

* add more memory to your system, see the [pixel cache](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#cache);
* add more cores to your system, see [threads of execution support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads);
* reduce lock contention with the [tcmalloc](http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html) memory allocation library;
* push large images to a solid-state drive, see [large image support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel).

If these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the image results. The default build is Q16 HDRI. If you disable [HDRI](https://imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php), you use half the memory and instead of predominantly floating point operations, you use the typically more efficient integer operations. The tradeoff is reduced precision and you cannot process out of range pixel values (e.g. negative). If you build the Q8 non-HDRI version of ImageMagick, you again reduce the memory requirements in half-- and once again there is a tradeoff, even less precision and no out of range pixel values. For a Q8 non-HDRI build of ImageMagick, use these configure script options: **--with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-hdri**.

% A distributed pixel cache is an extension of the traditional pixel cache
% available on a single host.  The distributed pixel cache may span multiple
% servers so that it can grow in size and transactional capacity to support
% very large images.  Start up the pixel cache server on one or more machines.
% When you read or operate on an image and the local pixel cache resources are
% exhausted, ImageMagick contacts one or more of these remote pixel servers to
% store or retrieve pixels.

%  We provide these memory allocators:
%
%    AcquireCriticalMemory(): allocate a small memory request with
%      AcquireMagickMemory(), however, on fail throw a fatal exception and exit.
%      Free the memory reserve with RelinquishMagickMemory().
%    AcquireAlignedMemory(): allocate a small memory request that is aligned
%      on a cache line.  On fail, return NULL for possible recovery.
%      Free the memory reserve with RelinquishMagickMemory().
%    AcquireMagickMemory()/ResizeMagickMemory(): allocate a small to medium
%      memory request, typically with malloc()/realloc(). On fail, return NULL
%      for possible recovery.  Free the memory reserve with
%      RelinquishMagickMemory().
%    AcquireQuantumMemory()/ResizeQuantumMemory(): allocate a small to medium
%      memory request.  This is a secure memory allocator as it accepts two
%      parameters, count and quantum, to ensure the request does not overflow.
%      It also check to ensure the request does not exceed the maximum memory
%      per the security policy.  Free the memory reserve with
%      RelinquishMagickMemory().
%    AcquireVirtualMemory(): allocate a large memory request either in heap,
%      memory-mapped, or memory-mapped on disk depending on whether heap
%      allocation fails or if the request exceeds the maximum memory policy.
%      Free the memory reserve with RelinquishVirtualMemory().
%    ResetMagickMemory(): fills the bytes of the memory area with a constant
%      byte.
%
%  In addition, we provide hooks for your own memory constructor/destructors.
%  You can also utilize our internal custom allocator as follows: Segregate
%  our memory requirements from any program that calls our API.  This should
%  help reduce the risk of others changing our program state or causing memory
%  corruption.
%
%  Our custom memory allocation manager implements a best-fit allocation policy
%  using segregated free lists.  It uses a linear distribution of size classes
%  for lower sizes and a power of two distribution of size classes at higher
%  sizes.  It is based on the paper, "Fast Memory Allocation using Lazy Fits."
%  written by Yoo C. Chung.
%
%  By default, C's standard library is used (e.g. malloc);  use the
%  custom memory allocator by defining MAGICKCORE_ANONYMOUS_MEMORY_SUPPORT
%  to allocate memory with private anonymous mapping rather than from the
%  heap.

% Morphology is the application of various kernels, of any size or shape, to an
% image in various ways (typically binary, but not always).
%
% Convolution (weighted sum or average) is just one specific type of
% morphology. Just one that is very common for image blurring and sharpening
% effects.  Not only 2D Gaussian blurring, but also 2-pass 1D Blurring.
%
% This module provides not only a general morphology function, and the ability
% to apply more advanced or iterative morphologies, but also functions for the
% generation of many different types of kernel arrays from user supplied
% arguments. Prehaps even the generation of a kernel from a small image.

%
%  Realism in computer graphics typically requires using 24 bits/pixel to
%  generate an image.  Yet many graphic display devices do not contain the
%  amount of memory necessary to match the spatial and color resolution of
%  the human eye.  The Quantize methods takes a 24 bit image and reduces
%  the number of colors so it can be displayed on raster device with less
%  bits per pixel.  In most instances, the quantized image closely
%  resembles the original reference image.
%
%  A reduction of colors in an image is also desirable for image
%  transmission and real-time animation.
%
%  QuantizeImage() takes a standard RGB or monochrome images and quantizes
%  them down to some fixed number of colors.
%
%  For purposes of color allocation, an image is a set of n pixels, where
%  each pixel is a point in RGB space.  RGB space is a 3-dimensional
%  vector space, and each pixel, Pi,  is defined by an ordered triple of
%  red, green, and blue coordinates, (Ri, Gi, Bi).
%
%  Each primary color component (red, green, or blue) represents an
%  intensity which varies linearly from 0 to a maximum value, Cmax, which
%  corresponds to full saturation of that color.  Color allocation is
%  defined over a domain consisting of the cube in RGB space with opposite
%  vertices at (0,0,0) and (Cmax, Cmax, Cmax).  QUANTIZE requires Cmax =
%  255.
%
%  The algorithm maps this domain onto a tree in which each node
%  represents a cube within that domain.  In the following discussion
%  these cubes are defined by the coordinate of two opposite vertices (vertex
%  nearest the origin in RGB space and the vertex farthest from the origin).
%
%  The tree's root node represents the entire domain, (0,0,0) through
%  (Cmax,Cmax,Cmax).  Each lower level in the tree is generated by
%  subdividing one node's cube into eight smaller cubes of equal size.
%  This corresponds to bisecting the parent cube with planes passing
%  through the midpoints of each edge.
%
%  The basic algorithm operates in three phases: Classification,
%  Reduction, and Assignment.  Classification builds a color description
%  tree for the image.  Reduction collapses the tree until the number it
%  represents, at most, the number of colors desired in the output image.
%  Assignment defines the output image's color map and sets each pixel's
%  color by restorage_class in the reduced tree.  Our goal is to minimize
%  the numerical discrepancies between the original colors and quantized
%  colors (quantization error).
%
%  Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of
%  sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
%  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color description
%  tree in the storage_class phase for realistic values of Cmax.  If
%  colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit precision,
%  so that Cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the root node to
%  allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.  This becomes
%  prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is 1 +
%  sum(i=1, k, 8k).
%
%  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, Cmax = 255.
%  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
%  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
%  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
%  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
%
%  For each pixel in the input image, storage_class scans downward from
%  the root of the color description tree.  At each level of the tree it
%  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
%  containing the pixel's color.  It updates the following data for each
%  such node:
%
%    n1: Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube which
%    this node represents;
%
%    n2: Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
%    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
%    leaves of the tree.
%
%    Sr, Sg, Sb: Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for all
%    pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of these sums
%    and n2 will ultimately characterize the mean color of a set of pixels
%    represented by this node.
%
%    E: the distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
%    within a node and the nodes' center.  This represents the
%    quantization error for a node.
%
%  Reduction repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes with n2
%  > 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed in
%  the output image.  On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
%  those nodes whose E count is minimal for pruning and merges their color
%  statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern node
%  selection as follows:
%
%    Ep = 0
%    while number of nodes with (n2 > 0) > required maximum number of colors
%      prune all nodes such that E <= Ep
%      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
%
%  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
%  two nodes together.
%
%  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
%  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
%  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
%  corresponding data in that node's parent.  This retains the pruned
%  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
%
%  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
%  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors.  When n2
%  > 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
%  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
%  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
%
%  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors within
%  the cubic volume which the node represents.  This includes n1 - n2
%  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in the
%  tree.
%
%  Assignment generates the output image from the pruned tree.  The output
%  image consists of two parts: (1)  A color map, which is an array of
%  color descriptions (RGB triples) for each color present in the output
%  image;  (2)  A pixel array, which represents each pixel as an index
%  into the color map array.
%
%  First, the assignment phase makes one pass over the pruned color
%  description tree to establish the image's color map.  For each node
%  with n2  > 0, it divides Sr, Sg, and Sb by n2 .  This produces the mean
%  color of all pixels that classify no lower than this node.  Each of
%  these colors becomes an entry in the color map.
%
%  Finally,  the assignment phase reclassifies each pixel in the pruned
%  tree to identify the deepest node containing the pixel's color.  The
%  pixel's value in the pixel array becomes the index of this node's mean
%  color in the color map.
%
%  This method is based on a similar algorithm written by Paul Raveling.

%  Segment segments an image by analyzing the histograms of the color
%  components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy
%  c-means technique.  The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms of
%  the three color components of the image and identifies a set of
%  classes.  The extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the
%  image with thresholding.  The color associated with each class is
%  determined by the mean color of all pixels within the extents of a
%  particular class.  Finally, any unclassified pixels are assigned to
%  the closest class with the fuzzy c-means technique.
%
%  The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:
%
%    o Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
%
%    o For each histogram, successively apply the scale-space filter and
%      build an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative
%      at each scale.  Analyze this scale-space ''fingerprint'' to
%      determine which peaks and valleys in the histogram are most
%      predominant.
%
%    o The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram.
%      Each interval contains either a minima or a maxima in the original
%      signal.  If each color component lies within the maxima interval,
%      that pixel is considered ''classified'' and is assigned an unique
%      class number.
%
%    o Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding
%      pass is classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique.  It is
%      assigned to one of the classes discovered in the histogram analysis
%      phase.
%
%  The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding
%  the local minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error
%  objective function.  A pixel is assigned to the closest class of
%  which the fuzzy membership has a maximum value.
%
%  Segment is strongly based on software written by Andy Gallo,
%  University of Delaware.

%  The XShearImage() and YShearImage() methods are based on the paper "A Fast
%  Algorithm for General Raster Rotation" by Alan W. Paeth, Graphics
%  Interface '86 (Vancouver).  ShearRotateImage() is adapted from a similar
%  method based on the Paeth paper written by Michael Halle of the Spatial
%  Imaging Group, MIT Media Lab.

%  The conjure program gives you the ability to perform custom image processing
%  tasks from a script written in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL). MSL is
%  XML-based and consists of action statements with attributes. Actions include
%  reading an image, processing an image, getting attributes from an image,
%  writing an image, and more. An attribute is a key/value pair that modifies
%  the behavior of an action.

%  The identify program describes the format and characteristics of one or more
%  image files. It also reports if an image is incomplete or corrupt. The
%  information returned includes the image number, the file name, the width and
%  height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not, the number of
%  colors in the image, the number of bytes in the image, the format of the
%  image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds it took to read
%  and process the image. Many more attributes are available with the verbose
%  option.

%  Use the mogrify program to resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither,

%  change the file suffix with the -format option) with any changes you

%
%  Read a stream of characters and return tokens one at a time.
%
%  The input stream is divided into individual 'tokens' (representing 'words'
%  or 'options'), in a way that is as close to a UNIX shell, as is feasible.
%  Only shell variable, and command substitutions will not be performed.
%  Tokens can be any length.
%
%  The main function call is GetScriptToken() (see below) which returns one
%  and only one token at a time.  The other functions provide support to this
%  function, opening scripts, and setting up the required structures.
%
%  More specifically...
%
%  Tokens are white space separated, and may be quoted, or even partially
%  quoted by either single or double quotes, or the use of backslashes,
%  or any mix of the three.
%
%  For example:    This\ is' a 'single" token"
%
%  A token is returned immediately the end of token is found. That is as soon
%  as a unquoted white-space or EOF condition has been found.  That is to say
%  the file stream is parsed purely character-by-character, regardless any
%  buffering constraints set by the system.  It is not parsed line-by-line.
%
%  The function will return 'MagickTrue' if a valid token was found, while
%  the token status will be set accordingly to 'OK' or 'EOF', according to
%  the cause of the end of token.  The token may be an empty string if the
%  input was a quoted empty string.  Other error conditions return a value of
%  MagickFalse, indicating any token found but was incomplete due to some
%  error condition.
%
%  Single quotes will preserve all characters including backslashes. Double
%  quotes will also preserve backslashes unless escaping a double quote,
%  or another backslashes.  Other shell meta-characters are not treated as
%  special by this tokenizer.
%
%  For example Quoting the quote chars:
%              \'  "'"       \"  '"'  "\""      \\  '\'  "\\"
%
%  Outside quotes, backslash characters will make spaces, tabs and quotes part
%  of a token returned. However a backslash at the end of a line (and outside
%  quotes) will cause the newline to be completely ignored (as per the shell
%  line continuation).
%
%  Comments start with a '#' character at the start of a new token, will be
%  completely ignored upto the end of line, regardless of any backslash at the
%  end of the line.  You can escape a comment '#', using quotes or backslashes
%  just as you can in a shell.
%
%  The parser will accept both newlines, returns, or return-newlines to mark
%  the EOL. Though this is technically breaking (or perhaps adding to) the
%  'BASH' syntax that is being followed.
%
%
%  UNIX script Launcher...
%
%  The use of '#' comments allow normal UNIX 'scripting' to be used to call on
%  the "magick" command to parse the tokens from a file
%
%    #!/path/to/command/magick -script
%
%
%  UNIX 'env' command launcher...
%
%  If "magick" is renamed "magick-script" you can use a 'env' UNIX launcher
%
%    #!/usr/bin/env magick-script
%
%
%  Shell script launcher...
%
%  As a special case a ':' at the start of a line is also treated as a comment
%  This allows a magick script to ignore a line that can be parsed by the shell
%  and not by the magick script (tokenizer).  This allows for an alternative
%  script 'launcher' to be used for magick scripts.
%
%    #!/bin/sh
%    :; exec magick -script "$0" "$@"; exit 10
%    #
%    # The rest of the file is magick script
%    -read label:"This is a Magick Script!"
%    -write show: -exit
%
% Or with some shell pre/post processing...
%
%    #!/bin/sh
%    :; echo "This part is run in the shell, but ignored by Magick"
%    :; magick -script "$0" "$@"
%    :; echo "This is run after the "magick" script is finished!"
%    :; exit 10
%    #
%    # The rest of the file is magick script
%    -read label:"This is a Magick Script!"
%    -write show: -exit
%
%
%  DOS script launcher...
%

%  Stream is a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of the
%  image or portion of the image to your choice of storage formats. It writes
%  the pixel components as they are read from the input image a row at a time
%  making stream desirable when working with large images or when you require
%  raw pixel components.

%   20071202 TS * rewrote RLE decoder - old version could cause buffer overflows
%               * failure of RLE decoding now throws error RLEDecoderError
%               * fixed bug in RLE decoding - now all rows are decoded, not just
%     the first one
%   * fixed bug in reader - record offsets now handled correctly
%   * fixed bug in reader - only bits 0..2 indicate compression type
%               * in writer: now using image color count instead of depth

config/ltmain.sh

This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
of too.

For the simplest scripts you might need only:

  #!/bin/sh
  . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
  . relative/path/to/options-parser
  scriptversion=1.0
  func_options ${1+"$@"}
  eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
  ...rest of your script...

In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# Copyright'.

For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
'# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.

The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
'--verbose'.

After sourcing this file, you can plug in processing for additional
options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
section further down.

config/ltmain.sh

func_version
------------
Echo version message to standard output and exit.
The version message is extracted from the calling file's header
comments, with leading '# ' stripped:
  1. First display the progname and version
  2. Followed by the header comment line matching  /^# Written by /
  3. Then a blank line followed by the first following line matching
     /^# Copyright /
  4. Immediately followed by any lines between the previous matches,
     except lines preceding the intervening completely blank line.
For example, see the header comments of this file.

Convert the specified POSIX path to a Windows path under MinGW and Cygwin

to apply for each Windows backslash position in order to support varying
levels of variable substitutions in scripts.

Note that Cygwin includes the 'cygpath' utility, which already provides
path translation capability.
