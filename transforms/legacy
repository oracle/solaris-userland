# Specify which packages are to be moved to 'legacy' namespace. Please see
# doc/packaging.txt section "Component EOF (End Of Feature)". This file is
# needed only for special cases, usually you just want to add 'set
# name=pkg.legacy value=true' to your packages.
#

#
# Name the affected packages and depend actions here. The lines here just
# 'mark' the lines by setting 'mark_legacy' attribute. All such marked lines
# will be processed below.
# An example can be:
# <transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(my/package) -> set mark_legacy true>
# matching multiple packages is possible
# <transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/perl-5/.*-522.*) -> set mark_legacy true>
#

# Python 2.7 and all related packages
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(-27).* -> set mark_legacy true>

# Beware that it's not easy to put python (or perl/ruby) module to legacy if
# you are at the same time putting to legacy one python (perl/ruby) version.
# For example if you put 'set name=pkg.legacy value=true' into
# components/python/enum/enum-PYVER.p5m and you are having python 27 runtime in
# legacy, then library/python/enum-27 will obtain the line twice. Once from
# *.p5m and once from this transform for every python 2.7 module. And the full
# build fails as pkglint throws an error on that duplicate line. So it's
# probably easier for such modules to list them here instead of putting the
# legacy to *.p5m.

# Mark packages which are unnecessary in newer runtimes.
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/python/backports.functools_lru_cache).* -> set mark_legacy true>
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/python/enum).* -> set mark_legacy true>
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/python/funcsigs).* -> set mark_legacy true>
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/python/ipaddress).* -> set mark_legacy true>
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(library/python/scandir).* -> set mark_legacy true>

# The following packages should not be marked
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=(pkg:/+)?.*(developer/build/scons-27) -> delete mark_legacy true>

# Automatic processing starts here, no change is needed beyond this line

#
# Make sure that we don't modify packages created from the history files
# (tools/generate-history adds do_not_move_to_legacy=true)
#
# First we remove (unmark) the package by removing the mark_legacy attribute
<transform set name=pkg.fmri do_not_move_to_legacy=true mark_legacy=.* -> delete mark_legacy .*>
# Now we can get rid of do_not_move_to_legacy attribute as we don't need it anymore
<transform set name=pkg.fmri do_not_move_to_legacy=.* -> delete do_not_move_to_legacy .*>

# Add legacy metadata
<transform set name=pkg.fmri mark_legacy=true -> \
    emit set name=pkg.legacy value=true>

# remove mark_legacy attribute as we don't need it anymore
<transform set name=pkg.fmri mark_legacy=.* -> delete mark_legacy .*>
