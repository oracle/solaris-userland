================================================================================

This guide describes steps to set up a system making sure whether the manifest
(*.p5m) we have in the is still correct and complete.



The Goal
========
Makes sure that the component manifest (p5m) delivers all the files from the
proto area. An example could be when CBE is updated with new library, component
X starts to use it and because of that delivers new file. But this file is not
in it's p5m manifest and there is no warning that there is such new file. If
component X has 'manifest-check' implemented we'll get an error during 'gmake
publish'.

The goal of the manifest check is to define how the manifest file (*.p5m) is
created out of the proto area. And compare the result to the existing p5m files
to make sure that there are no files or other changes left behind.

Other way of describing it would be that "manifest check" is set of pkgmogrify
transformations applied to "gmake sample-manifest" output.



Operation
=========
The process is to combine multiple information sources and compare the result
to the p5m files. That is to create this_component.p5m it considers:
 - contents of the proto directories itself (gmake sample-manifest output)
   ( 5) )
 - pkgmogrify transform file generate/this_component.generate
   ( 6) - 8) )
 - the existing this_component.p5m file
   ( 9) )
 - fixed set of action read from generate/this_component.static
   ( 10) )

In detail, these are the steps taken in order to form p5m file

1) "gmake manifest-check" is executed. Either by hand or as part of "gmake
   publish" command.

2) "manifest-check" makes sure that the component was "gmake install"ed

3) list of existing *.p5m files in the component is collected and for each such
   file tools/manifest_generator is executed.

4) for component.p5m manifest_generator checks whether corresponding
   generate/component.generate exists. If not, info message is printed and the
   tool exists with return code 0 (success).

5) manifest_generator collects list of existing files in proto areas (like
   gmake sample-manifest would do). Please note that you can specify additional
   proto directories in $(GENERATE_PROTO_DIRS) variable in a form
   "directory^transpose" so that every file/link/etc. in "directory" produces
   action with path=transpose/... .

6) There are three mogrify transform files applied
  - $(GENERATE_TRANSFORMS) - that is to get the output the same as
    "gmake sample-manifest". By default that is transforms/generate-cleanup
  - $(MANIFEST_CLEANUP_TRANSFORM) - that contains common actions needed to do
    make the sample-manifest output similar to the actual p5m. That is dropping
    directories, moving files from "mangled" dir into root directory etc. That
    is by default transforms/manifest-check-cleanup.
  - $(TRANSFORM) - that is the generate/component.generate itself

7) The output is saved as build/manifest-*-generate.debug. That file is
   intended to help with debugging the manifest check process.

8) The debug file is stripped of debug lines, passed through pkgfmt and long
   actions which are split on multiple lines are joined into one again. The
   result is filtered through uniq(1) to remove duplicate lines. Duplicate
   lines can be generated for example if you have man page in the component and
   the man page appears later in the "mangled" directory too.

9) manifest_generator takes all pkgmogrify transforms (<transform ... and
   <include ...), "set", "depend" and "license" actions from existing
   component.p5m file. It also takes all actions with variant.arch set to
   anything else to what our current architecture is. These actions can not be
   guessed so are copied out of exiting p5m file

10) The contents of generate/component.static is read if it exists

11) The combined result is stripped of comments and formatted using pkgfmt(1)

12) Existing p5m file is stripped of comments and compared to our result

13) If the two manifests match exactly "manifest-check" exits with 0,
    otherwise it prints the differences and exits with 1.
    "gmake manifest-check" exits with an error in such case.



Best practices
==============

Converting a common string to a variable
-------------------------------------------------------------------
When you have a lot of files like

     file path=usr/perl5/blah/...
     file path=usr/perl5/blah/...

And you want to convert it to $(PERLPATH) defined in the Makefile

     file path=$(PERLPATH)/blah/...

You have to use a little trick

     # Convert the string into $!(PERLPATH)
     <transform dir file link hardlink -> edit path "$(PERLPATH)" "$!(PERLPATH)">
     # Remove the exclamation mark
     <transform dir file link hardlink -> edit path "\$!\((.*)\)" "$(\1)">


Install a file to a location different to where it is in proto area
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Set action hash to current path so that IPS can find it
     <transform file path=usr/bin/ -> set action.hash %(path)>
     # "Move" the file to it's new location
     <transform file path=usr/bin/ -> edit path ^/usr/bin /usr/gnu/bin >


Multiple *p5m files in a component
----------------------------------
Create a generate/common.transform file. That sorts the files according to
which package it belongs. Other *.generate files will include this common
transform.

     # Make sure that all files are assigned to a manifest
     <transform dir file link hardlink -> set pkg.type main>

     # Override for files belonging to different manifest
     <transform file link path=.*\.pl$ -> set pkg.type perl>
     <transform file link path=.*\.py$ -> set pkg.type python>

The perl .generate file would then contain
     <include generate/common.transform>

     # Drop everything not belonging to 'perl'
     <transform dir file link hardlink pkg.type=(?!perl) -> drop>

     # Remove the mark
     <transform dir file link hardlink -> delete pkg.type .*>



Limitations
===========
 - Comments are ignored and not compared
 - While processing Python and Perl modules the variables like $(PYVER) and
   $(PERLVER) are not available - you have to match strings like python-[0-9.]+
   instead of python-$(PYVER).
